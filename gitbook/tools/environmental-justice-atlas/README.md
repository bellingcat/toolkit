## Description

Launched in 2012, the Environmental Justice Atlas (also known as the EJAtlas) is a project based on the work of [hundreds of contributors](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/) including academics, citizens, informal committees, NGOs and other activist groups. The database is meant to be a resource for teaching, networking and advocacy of social conflicts involving environmental issues around the world. It can also be a helpful resource for open source researchers due to its archive of information that can provide history and context of conflict.

The map covers conflicts across 10 [categories](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/) including:

* Nuclear
* Mineral Ores and Building Extractions
* Waste Management
* Biomass and Land Conflicts
* Fossil Fuels
* Energy and Climate Justice
* Water Management
* Infrastructure and Built Environment
* Tourism Recreation
* Biodiversity Conservation Conflicts
* Industrial and Utilities Conflicts

The database contains information on investors, details about deals, conflict impacts, project details, outcomes, references to legislation, academic research, videos and images.

Open source researchers may find the map also useful for finding historical information, links to relevant organizations and source materials, and to get an overview of specific conflicts. The map can be filtered by multiple types of criteria, including region, start/end date, type of conflict and more. A researcher may also perform searches such as entering the word "gas," and the search results will include any entry that uses the word "gas" in the text.

Depending on the entry, information may be available in languages like English, French, Italian, Chinese, Arabic, or Turkish. Not all entries will be available in multiple languages.

## Requirements

Internet access is required to access the atlas.

## Limitations

In its [FAQ](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/), EJAtlas specifically acknowledges that there are limitations to the data. For instance, the extent to which conflicts are covered varies and information on changing conflicts might not be kept up to date. In addition, volunteers' interests may shape how conflicts are portrayed and there is uneven global coverage. Some entries may only be available in English.

In the FAQ, the team also addresses issues of data quality, stating that all data that can be found on their site is "based and derived from secondary sources” which they aim to have from “trusted publications”. However, the team behind the site does not verify the information that can be found in those secondary sources.

## Ethical Considerations

None.

## Guide

While not a guide, the site's [FAQ](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/) can be helpful for context and background information.
