## Description

Insecam shows live feeds of internet protocol (IP) surveillance cameras around the world. The live feeds are made available on this site because the camera owners did not change the camera's password to be different from the default factory setting. \

Insecam allows searches by location (city, country, type of place, timezone) and camera brand.

The camera feeds show a variety of public spaces. Camera feeds of private residences are not shown on the site.&#x20;
