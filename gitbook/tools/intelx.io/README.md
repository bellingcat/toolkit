## Ethical Considerations

Consider the strong ethical implications of examining leaked user data. Depending on the ethical and legal standards of your work, you may decide whether or not to use it. Assess if researching a person of interest in the leaked database is justified by the potential public benefit. Does the end justify the means?

If you decide to proceed, do not use the data to hack into accounts. Instead, consider methods used by open source researchers, such as using intelx to find associated accounts (e.g., discovering a Twitter account from an email address) and to gather more information on a research subject, like their date of birth.
