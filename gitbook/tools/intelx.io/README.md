Intelx lets you search email addresses (and other inputs) in its database of information from the darknet, document sharing platforms, whois data, public data leaks and others. You can expect to find associated accounts, names, IP addresses, passwords, dates of birth, etc.&#x20;

&#x20;In the example below, Intelx finds a particular email address in a leak of Twitter and Chegg. The twitter one shows info on names, screen names, followers and the creation time. The Chegg database shows email addresses and their passwords.

## Ethical Considerations

Consider the strong ethical implications of examining leaked user data. Depending on the ethical and legal standards of your work, you may decide whether or not to use it. Assess if researching a person of interest in the leaked database is justified by the potential public benefit. Does the end justify the means?

If you decide to proceed, do not use the data to hack into accounts. Instead, consider methods used by open source researchers, such as using intelx to find associated accounts (e.g., discovering a Twitter account from an email address) and to gather more information on a research subject, like their date of birth.
