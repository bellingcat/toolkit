## Description

RAMMB/CIRA SLIDER is a tool for viewing images from weather satellites around the planet in real-time. While these weather satellites are low resolution (the highest resolution satellites have only a 500 meter resolution), the data is updated as fast as every 5 minutes. Additionally, the satellites capture [multispectral imagery](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2025/01/10/satellite-imagery-bands-guide/) that can highlight fires, vegetation, and atmospheric properties like moisture and types of cloud cover.

These images are useful for monitoring large scale events, typically weather events such as wildfires, hurricanes and dust storms. By default, the tool animates a number of images, which is often useful for showing developing weather patterns. The parameters of this animation (length of time and number of frames) can be adjusted. The tool can display a number of different "data products." The default "GeoColor CIRA" option is useful for simulating a color view of the planet, but other options like "Fire Temperature CIRA" can be useful for visualizing particular phenomenon. Images and GIFs can be exported from the tool with the built in Download feature.&#x20;
