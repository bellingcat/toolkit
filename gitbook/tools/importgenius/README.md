## Description

ImportGenius is an online database of trade data (imports and exports) for countries including the US, Russia and India. The list of countries is on the [pricing page](https://www.importgenius.com/pricing) (scroll down to 'Global trade data'), though ImportGenius can provide journalists with records for countries which they haven't yet added to their platform. [Data sources include](https://www.importgenius.com/how-it-works) government public records, customs agencies and trade databases.

When logged in you can do custom searches:

In the search results, you can see details for a specific shipment by clicking on the 'Details' icon:

ImportGenius has a 'Visual Mapping' view that gives you a network diagram of shipments for importers and exporters:

The network diagram allows you to explore relationships between trading entities. In the diagram above, you can see the other companies to which the exporter (in blue) provided shipments.

You can export search results, save searches so it's easy to repeat them, and get email alerts when new shipments matching your search criteria clear Customs.

Fields provided include at least one of the parties involved in the transaction, a description of the goods involved and their weight, and the origin and destination of the shipment. There are additional fields that depend on the source data - report fields differ per country. Note that data for different countries is updated at different intervals.

All modes of transport (e.g. ship, road) are covered, except for the United States, which is maritime only.

A wide range of other sites provide a similar service, with  different country coverage. Most do not offer free access to journalists. Free access to US trade data is available through [ImportYeti](https://app.gitbook.com/o/WQpOq5ZFue4N6m65QCJq/s/GJyHaCYBR6gnNIW1tHhY/).
