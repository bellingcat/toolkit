## Description

Here WeGo is a navigation app that can serve as an alternative to popular services like [Google Maps](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/google-maps) and [Apple Maps](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/apple-maps). Open source researchers that are familiar with either platform will find many of the same basic features present on the Here WeGo website or application. However, Here WeGo does not offer a StreetView feature.&#x20;

Here WeGo offers users the option to overlay environmental zones over the map they are viewing. This provides an easily digestible view of low-emissions or similar types of other zones in a particular area.

Unlike some competitors, Here WeGo emphasizes user privacy. It collects minimal data compared to other navigation apps, which is a significant plus for privacy-conscious users​​. More information on their privacy features have been detailed [here](https://falconlinkvpn.com/blog/best-google-maps-alternatives/) and [here](https://www.routific.com/blog/google-maps-alternatives). The sharing of traffic data on the mobile application is optional and users are informed that any data that they do share will be anonymised.

## Requirements

The tool does not require you to sign in to use it. However, on the web version there are certain functions that require you to sign in. These include saving locations in a "collection".\
\
Registering for an account can be done via Facebook or with an email address. The latter option also requests a name, birth date and a country or region.

## Limitations

Unlike some other satellite imagery tools, Here WeGo does not appear to indicate the date of the images it displays. Nor does it offer different chronological options, which may be limiting for researchers looking to assign a specific time to an image.

## Ethical Considerations

Satellite imagery captures images of the earth indiscriminately. Here WeGo's displays of satellite imagery may therefore cause sensitive or private images and information about individuals or organisations to become unexpectedly public. Researchers are encouraged to make use of Here WeGo and the information it provides responsibly and for research in the public interest.

## Guides and articles

A guide to what Here WeGo, its setup and its use is available on a community-run website [here](https://www.herewego.info/en/here-wego/).

## Tool provider

The tool is created and maintained by an entity named Here Technologies. They are a Dutch multinational headquartered in Amsterdam that is majority owned by a consortium of German automotive companies. The entity's core business revolves around lisencing mapping content to other companies.
