## Description

The Telegram Group Joiner is a web-based automation tool that facilitates the addition of a Telegram account to multiple groups. It is particularly useful for researchers who are focusing on a specific research topic and who need to monitor key Telegram groups, including private channels with invite links.

The tool allows preloading of group URLs by appending them to a base URL, separated by semicolons. This automation is executed fully client-side using tdlib for a robust Telegram API experience. It is worth mentioning that the tool only operates client-side, ensuring no data retention on servers.

## Requirements

**Telegram API Keys:** [Obtain your API ID and API Hash](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). This involves registering an application to receive these credentials. After entering the API ID and Hash, the tool will ask for your phone number and the 5-digit login code that Telegram sends you.

Use a modern desktop browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. (The page relies on WebAssembly; very old browsers (and some locked-down corporate ones) won’t load it. Safari older than v15 may fail to load the page.)

## Limitations

**Account Blocking Risk:** There is a risk that Telegram may block the automated account used for group additions. To mitigate this:

* Use a non-personal Telegram account dedicated to research purposes.
* Consider using a dedicated phone number ("burner number") when setting up the account.
* Utilize a VPN to enhance privacy and avoid potential geo-restrictions.
* Accounts created or [logged in via TDLib can be flagged and suspended without warning](https://github.com/tdlib/td/issues/2920); use a spare account.
* Telegram caps one account at roughly 500 groups/channels; after that, you’ll see ‘Limit reached’ errors.

## Ethical Considerations

* **Privacy and Consent:** Automating the joining of groups may raise ethical concerns, especially when it involves private groups. Ensure you have permission to join any private groups and comply with Telegram's terms of service.
* **Compliance with Platform Policies:** Users should familiarize themselves with Telegram's policies to avoid misuse of the platform.

## Guide

**Guide**

1.  **Access the Tool:**

    Visit the [Telegram Group Joiner](https://bellingcat.github.io/telegram-group-joiner/) webpage.
2.  **Authenticate:**

    Enter your API ID, API Hash, **and then the 5-digit code Telegram texts you**.
3.  **Prepare Group Links:**

    * You can preload group or channel links by using the `links` parameter in the URL.
    * Separate multiple links with a semicolon (`;`).

    **Example:**

    *   **Links:**

        ```
        https://t.me/bellingcat
        https://t.me/+privateInvite123id
        ```
    * Combined Links:\
      `https://t.me/bellingcat;https://t.me/+privateInvite,123id`
    * Resulting URL:\
      `https://bellingcat.github.io/telegram-group-joiner/?links=https://t.me/bellingcat;https://t.me/+privateInvite,123id`
4. **Join Groups:**
