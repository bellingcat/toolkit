## Description

Use Google Lens to identify objects or locations that are visible in an image. This can be useful if you want to geolocate an image, or find out more information about the objects, landmarks or vegetation in a photograph in order to better understand its contents. Primarily a mobile phone application, it can also be used in the Chrome browser.&#x20;

Google Lens now uses Google's AI tools to identify objects and places that feature in the images you search, and will sometimes provide you with an AI overview.&#x20;

### Using the Google Photos mobile application&#x20;

Open a photograph in the [Google Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos) mobile application and click the Google Lens![](<.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)  icon at the bottom of the image. The app will highlight a specific part of the image in a rectangle, which you can move by dragging, or re-size using one of the corners, to make sure it captures your specific area or object of interest.

You can also add keywords using the Google search bar, which is at the top of this screenshot, to narrow down your search.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

You can also click 'About this image' (see Screenshot 4) to find out more information regarding the content of the image. There is now also an option to use AI mode, which integrates Google's Gemini AI with Google Lens's visual search capabilities.

### Using Google Lens in the browser&#x20;

Right click any photo you come across while browsing the Internet using Google Chrome and click 'Search with Google Lens'. The results will be shown on the right.&#x20;

## Requirements

You need the [Google Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos) application on your mobile phone if you want to search an image in your gallery. Otherwise, you can use Google Lens with Google Chrome or the Google application (see the Google Support page [here ](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/15086890?hl=en)for more information).

## Limitations

Google Lens is getting more sophisticated with time, but it doesn't always work, especially with landmarks or objects that are less well-known or common. It is, however, a very useful first port of call and can potentially save you time.

## Ethical Considerations

Make sure you analyse the search results critically and cross-reference these with other sources of information to ensure you draw the right conclusions and your findings are accurate. Do not use copyright images without permission.&#x20;
