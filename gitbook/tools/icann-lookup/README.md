# ICANN Lookup

## URL

[https://lookup.icann.org/](https://lookup.icann.org/)

## Description

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a private non-profit corporation that coordinates the allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

ICANN Lookup is a free public service that gives you the ability to look up publicly available contact and other information related to a domain name or an internet number resource. Also known as [WHOIS](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/whois-rdds-2023-11-02-en), domain registration data identifies who owns a domain and how to get in contact with them.

If you run the URL of a website through this tool, you might be able to find out the status of the domain, relevant dates, such as the date it was created, updated, or is set to expire, and the names and contact details of the registrant (the individual or entity that registered the domain name) or the registrar (a third-party organisation used by individuals and entities to register domains).

This real-time data comes directly from registrars or registry operators. Registry operators are the organisations that maintain master databases of all domains in a particular top-level domain.

Often, and especially for larger organisations, WHOIS information is now redacted. After the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was implemented in 2018, ICANN redacted millions of WHOIS records from the public domain (see [here ](https://www.inta.org/news-and-press/inta-news/the-european-union-tackles-the-whois-issue/)for more information). Many companies and individuals also use registrars like Domains by Proxy LLC or GoDaddy Inc. to provide a further layer of anonymity. **However, historical domain registration information is still available via some paid platforms (see Limitations below).**

Nevertheless, this is an easy and free check that is well worth trying if you come across a website with interesting information and would like to know the source or possible author of that information.

## Limitations

ICANN does not provide historical ownership information or screenshots for the domain in question. Consider accessing this data through more sophisticated, paid platforms like [DomainTools](https://whois.domaintools.com/) or [DeHashed](https://dehashed.com/), or explore some of the other solutions in the Guides and Articles section below.

In November 2023, ICANN launched the [Registration Data Request Service](https://rdrs.icann.org/) (RDRS), an online portal whereby users deemed to have a legitimate interest (including law enforcement, government agencies, intellectual property attorneys, cybersecurity professionals, and others) can request registration data from registrants. However, RDRS does not guarantee access to the registration data. All communication and data disclosure between the registrars and requestors takes place outside of the system.

## Ethical Considerations

The results may contain personal information. Make sure you carefully analyse and cross-reference any information, especially personal details, you come across via this tool with other independent sources to make sure your research is correct.
