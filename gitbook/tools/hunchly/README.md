## Description

Hunchly is an online investigation tool that automatically captures and documents every web page a researcher visits. It eliminates the need for manual note-taking, screenshots, or URL logging.&#x20;

This tool includes search functionality and history filtering of captured pages. Hunchly allows researchers to locate specific information within their saved web pages. Users can set keywords, what Hunchly calls "selectors", to track and record across web pages and can categorize these pages with tags. Hunchly supports regular expression (Regex) selectors. Users can also mark pages as important to review later or prioritize them in searches and when filtering results.

Hunchly creates a transparent audit trail, which is essential for ensuring the credibility and admissibility of collected data in professional and legal settings.

Available as a Google Chrome plugin, Mobile application, or [using Hunchly Cloud](https://youtu.be/j2-F_ywtOjU?si=lF7aoNRqNG3ORE5S) depending on your chosen plan.&#x20;

## Limitations

Hunchly highlights potential evidentiary challenges:&#x20;

* **Requires Chrome(ium):** Depending on your subscription, Hunchly requires installation on your computer, but it's usage relies on a Chrome Plug-in to be used.
* **Memory Usage:** As default, Hunchly stores data locally, you will need to allocate space on you own HD (or external HD) dedicated to all captures. Longer investigations will generate a bigger volume of data. Hunchly Cloud can be set up
* **Timestamp Mismatches**: Differences in time zones or delays in processing can cause discrepancies between the time recorded in Hunchly and the actual time of data capture, complicating evidence validation.
* **Non-Continuous Page IDs**: Universal Page IDs across multiple cases can result in gaps or non-sequential IDs in the evidence record, which may require additional explanation in legal proceedings.
* **Hash Integrity Issues**: Although Hunchly uses SHA-256 hashing to verify data integrity, this does not prevent tampering before the MHTML capture is reviewed. Modified content can be re-hashed to appear legitimate. Hunchly advises using additional verification methods such as GPG signatures, comparing live or archived web content, or securing original material through legal avenues to combat potential tampering.
* **GPG Signing Vulnerabilities**: Technically adept investigators can compromise locally generated GPG keys, allowing tampering and re-signing of evidence while maintaining a valid appearance. Additional verification methods include comparison with live or archived content.
* **Static Captures**: Hunchly will only capture information you have seen on the page, but not in motion. Videos will be archived as screenshots, and you might need other tools to download the full content (you can upload them to your Hunchly case afterwards).&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations when using Hunchly include:

* **Privacy and Consent**: Hunchly users should ensure that data collection complies with privacy laws and that consent is obtained when necessary.
* **Data Integrity**: To ensure the accuracy of evidence, Hunchly users must maintain the original state of collected data without alteration.
* **Transparency**: It's important for users to document and disclose how data is collected and processed using Hunchly in investigations.
* **Accountability**: Hunchly users are responsible for ethically using the tool to avoid misusing data or impacting case outcomes.
* **Security**: Users must protect sensitive information against unauthorized access and breaches.
