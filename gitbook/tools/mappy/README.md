## Description

Mapping and directions service for locations in Europe. Mappy provides directions for pedestrians, cars, motorcycles, buses and trains where available. It touts its real-time traffic information, which it says can help users determine the fastest routes to their destination. Mappy also gives users a street-view option in some locations in France. Using the Mappy app, users can view control zones and speed camera locations.&#x20;

Mappy is available as a website and as an app for Android and iOS devices.

The street-view option is only available in select locations in France.

## Ethical Considerations
