## Description

Resourcewatch is a webbased, open source environmental data aggregating platform that excels in user-friendly interactive maps and customisable dashboards. It combines geospatial and research data to provide insights on topics such as climate change, poverty, water risk, state instability, air pollution and human migration.

The datasets can be browsed by topic: Food and agriculture, Energy, Climate, Forests, Water, Society, Ocean, Cities, Coral Reefs and Air Quality. It is also possible to select on recent updates or by zooming in on geographic areas of interest, directly on the map.&#x20;

With an account it is possible to save and select geographical areas of interest, by selecting countries from a list or by drawing a polygon on the world map. Some datasets then provide alerts when relevant data to this area has been updated or added.&#x20;

Informative thematic dashboards are available, but do not include recent data. For some visualisations, it is possible to create a custom dashboard and to create public links to charts and visualisations so that they can be used in reports.&#x20;

Advanced data users can directly access the [Resourcewatch Github](https://github.com/resource-watch) page and build upon the open source code or [pull data by API](https://resourcewatch.org/get-involved/develop-your-app) to use in own applications. Examples of this are thematic data initiatives such as [Ocean Watch](https://blog.resourcewatch.org/2021/11/29/how-listening-to-a-sea-of-voices-can-transform-ocean-management/) and [Land & Carbon Lab](https://dobecology.foleon.com/go/4-optimism-in-times-of-crises/wri-resource-watch/#block-100185753).

## Data sources

Data comes from a wide range of external data providers: National governments, international organisations and UN agencies, research institutions and scientific publications. The dataproviders and update frequency are listed on the dataset detail pages.&#x20;

Resourcewatch is an aggregating platform and is not built for creating or correcting data, but does perform some preprocessing and standardisation to make the data usable in visualisations. Curating takes place by WRI domain experts or by peer review. It is possible to add your own datasets; check the [data policy](https://resourcewatch.org/get-involved/data-policy) for more information.&#x20;

## Use cases

Data from Resource Watch has been used for example, for:

* [monitoring tree cover loss and fires ](https://blog.resourcewatch.org/2019/04/11/how-resource-watch-changed-the-way-we-monitor-the-planets-pulse/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)within protected areas
* [providing data on environmental trends](https://blog.resourcewatch.org/2019/04/11/how-resource-watch-changed-the-way-we-monitor-the-planets-pulse/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and risks to financial institutions
* informing early warning systems for local officials in predicting when water stress can influence conflict and political instability before it spreads through the [Water, Peace and Security (WPS) initiative](https://www.un-ihe.org/news/water-peace-and-security-initiative)

## Cost

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

* Some familiarity with using large datasets will be necessary. A basic understanding of geospatial mapping techniques is desirable.  &#x20;
* Functionality as saving favourite datasets, defining areas of interest or creating custom dashboards require registration by email.&#x20;

## Limitations

{% hint style="success" %}
Overlaying different datasets are a strong feature of Resourcewatch. It can help uncover new patterns of areas of research, but be aware that correlations or patterns do not imply causation. Ensure that the time frame and spatial scales for the overlayed datasets are compatible before analysing the data or drawing conclusions.
{% endhint %}

* data is not real-time, however some datasets are near-real-time.&#x20;
* coverage: while the global map is always shown, the scope per dataset can differ. Be aware that data coverage gaps may occur; regions can be over- or underrepresented, specific environmental topics not included, and that governmental data could reflect reporting bias.&#x20;
* loading of interactive visualisation layers and widgets can be slow, or sometimes not load at all.&#x20;
* the provided dashboards per environmental category are insightful, but based on data from before 2018; complement with more recent data if needed.

## Guide

The platform is user-friendly and offers help per page. Watch [short video tutorials](./#url) on functionality as how to explore and overlay data, or how to create a custom dashboard.&#x20;

## Tool provider

[World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/) (US based); the platform was developed in partnership with over 30 founding partners including universities and private and public organisations worldwide.
