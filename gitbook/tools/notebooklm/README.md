## Description

AI powered research tool powered by Google's Gemini LLM. Bears a similarity to ChatGPT or Claude but only has the ability to reference sources that you've uploaded yourself. Essentially, it's a research assistant that can generate summaries, answers, or insights based your source data. It's remarkably useful for learning about a topic quickly by being able to directly communicate with your sources via text, voice, or visually.&#x20;

Why choose this over ChatGPT/Claude?: it only uses your source documents so it's far less likely to hallucinate or use unverified information from the wider web. \
\
Use cases:

* Comparison of information or viewpoints from different source documents
* Creating clarity from a tangle of sources or documents
* Summarizing interviews for a documentary
* Creating learning material for a crash-course on a complex topic<br>

#### Imagined Specific use case:

If you're looking to verify similarities between source documents/interviews/social media posts to understand where a specific disinformation campaign has spawned from, this could potentially allow you to quickly learn, understand, and analyze this information to make sense out of a jumbled mess.

* [ ] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

## Requirements

* Google Account

## Limitations

* this is not an LLM, although it is powered by Gemini. It can only reference from inside of your notebook (your sources)
* Doesn't seem to be useful for technical tasks, primarily a research/learning tool
* Size/document/chat limits on the free version
* Google stores and processes your information/source documents.



## Ethical Considerations

* Documents are stored and processed by Google, so this is not ideal for sensitive/classified information.
* Still has potential for hallucinating/misunderstanding your source information, although this seems to be substantially lower than LLMs like Claude and ChatGPT given that doesn't reference the wider web.
