## Description

{% hint style="danger" %}
Disclaimer: Munitions are dangerous. Do not approach them.&#x20;

This website contains information about ordnance, explosives and related items for educational and reference purposes only. The content should not be used for (1) attempting self-guided disposal of explosive devices; (2) manufacturing explosive devices or components; (3) handling explosive ordnance without proper training; (4) any illegal activities involving explosive materials.
{% endhint %}

Open Source Munitions Portal (OSMP) is a verified image repository of munition types. [It is a tool for researchers and journalists interested in learning about munition use and impact in conflicts.](https://osmp.ngo/about/) It contains more than 1000 images of [functioned munitions](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] and is particularly helpful for researchers, as it allows them to visually compare their image source with what is in the repository.

Any researcher or investigator interested in determining the type of munition used in a particular attack can visit the portal with their source imagery. They can then search through the portal’s images to make comparisons and see if they can find a match. If available, users will be able to find some, if not all of the following information about the munition: **Reported Location, Reported Year, Munition Category, Functional Use, Tentative Model, Base Color, Condition, Mechanical Feature, Guidance, Domain, Fins Characteristics, Caliber, Related Images, Research Organization, Marking Color, Marking Script.**

{% hint style="info" %}
[Every image has been reviewed by at least two specialists](https://osmp.ngo/about/) (See methodology) before it is published in the portal. Every entry has been classified under at least one munition category.

{% hint style="success" %}
**TIP:** Based on our tests, the portal is more beneficial for current conflicts and images of munition fragments than for unexploded munitions.

### Data Source

The portal’s data comes from various sources.&#x20;

1. Social Media - According to the tool providers, the portal sources its images from social media platforms sync as Twitter/X, Telegram, and Facebook [(see timestamp 00:16:11)](https://rss.com/podcasts/bellingcatstagetalk/1965759/). It predominantly uses Arabic- and Ukrainian-language social media ([see timestamp 00:30:48](https://rss.com/podcasts/bellingcatstagetalk/1965759/))
2. Partner organizations - OSMP signed formal agreements with these organizations [(timestamp 00:17:00)](https://rss.com/podcasts/bellingcatstagetalk/1965759/) to use their images in the portal and link them to the source and external reference page.&#x20;

3. Public Submissions - The portal allows the public to submit an image and contribute to the portal’s archive via [this form. ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc27fdYPQEvV6lKHwEpddw4nZdU1YD0GOIvXRBKimIh35g0RA/viewform)

{% hint style="info" %}
Submissions must include decent-quality images where the munition/remnant is visible and a source link. The team runs reverse-image searches on submitted content to seek the most reliable, closest-to-original sources before expert classification begins. [(Timestamp 00:29:02 - 00:30:21)](https://rss.com/podcasts/bellingcatstagetalk/1965759/)&#x20;

[^1]: The munition has either partially or fully operated, and the intended effect has occurred. For explosive munitions, this usually means a detonation. (Source: [https://osmp.ngo/resources/glossary/](https://osmp.ngo/resources/glossary/) )&#x20;
