{% hint style="danger" %}
Disclaimer: Munitions are dangerous. Do not approach them.&#x20;

This website contains information about ordnance, explosives and related items for educational and reference purposes only. The content should not be used for (1) attempting self-guided disposal of explosive devices; (2) manufacturing explosive devices or components; (3) handling explosive ordnance without proper training; (4) any illegal activities involving explosive materials.
{% endhint %}

Open Source Munitions Portal (OSMP) is a verified image repository of munition types. [It is a tool for researchers and journalists interested in learning about munition use and impact in conflicts.](https://osmp.ngo/about/) It contains more than 1000 images of [functioned munitions](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] and is particularly helpful for researchers, as it allows them to visually compare their image source with what is in the repository.

Any researcher or investigator interested in determining the type of munition used in a particular attack can visit the portal with their source imagery. They can then search through the portal’s images to make comparisons and see if they can find a match. If available, users will be able to find some, if not all of the following information about the munition: **Reported Location, Reported Year, Munition Category, Functional Use, Tentative Model, Base Color, Condition, Mechanical Feature, Guidance, Domain, Fins Characteristics, Caliber, Related Images, Research Organization, Marking Color, Marking Script.**

{% hint style="info" %}
[Every image has been reviewed by at least two specialists](https://osmp.ngo/about/) (See methodology) before it is published in the portal. Every entry has been classified under at least one munition category.

{% hint style="success" %}
**TIP:** Based on our tests, the portal is more beneficial for current conflicts and images of munition fragments than for unexploded munitions.

[^1]: The munition has either partially or fully operated, and the intended effect has occurred. For explosive munitions, this usually means a detonation. (Source: [https://osmp.ngo/resources/glossary/](https://osmp.ngo/resources/glossary/) )&#x20;
