<summary>What is the difference between munitions and explosive ordnance? <mark style="color:$success;"><strong>(CLICK TO EXPAND)</strong></mark></summary>

**Munitions** - “An expendable item which is designed to achieve lethal or non-lethal operational effects by means of an effect mechanism (e.g., blast, fragmentation, or smoke), and which travels from a source (e.g., individual weapon, vehicle, etc.), via a method of delivery (e.g., dropped from an aircraft, fired from a gun, etc.), to a target or target area.” [Source: OSMP Glossary](https://osmp.ngo/resources/glossary/)

The condition of munitions are sometimes referred to as “functioned” or “unfunctioned” munitions.&#x20;

* **Functioned** munitions - “The munition has either partially or fully operated and the intended effect has occurred. For explosive munitions, this usually means a detonation.” [Source: OSMP Glossary](https://osmp.ngo/resources/glossary/)
* **Unfunctioned** munitions - “The munition has not operated and the intended effect has not occurred.” [Source: OSMP Glossary](https://osmp.ngo/resources/glossary/)

**Explosive Ordnance (EO) -** is a subtype of munition “that contains explosives, including bombs and warheads; guided and ballistic missiles; artillery, mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunition; mines, torpedoes, and depth and demolition charges.” [Source: Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810104853749)<br>
