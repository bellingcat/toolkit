title: Hint on Munitions ID Tools Lexicon
---

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The three munitions ID databases have different scopes that create overlap and categorization inconsistencies. CAT-UXO catalogs explosive ordnance only and uses **'type'** as its organizing term. OSMP covers all munitions (including non-explosive) and uses **'munitions category.'** Bulletpicker has the broadest scope—ordnance plus related items like fuzes, containers, training aids, and components—organized under **'ordnance and related items.'** The same munition can appear in multiple databases but may be categorized differently depending on each tool's scope and organizational structure.
