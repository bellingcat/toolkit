title: Hint on Munitions ID Tools Lexicon
---

{% hint style="warning" %}
IMPORTANT NOTE: The following three munitions ID databases have different scopes that create overlap and categorization inconsistencies: [CAT-UXO](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/cat-uxo) catalogs explosive ordnance only and uses 'type' as its organizing term. OSMP covers all munitions (including non-explosive) and uses 'munitions category.' [Bulletpicker](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/bulletpicker.com) has the broadest scope—ordnance plus related items like fuzes, containers, training aids, and components—organized under 'ordnance and related items.' The same munition can appear in multiple databases but may be categorized differently depending on each tool's scope and organizational structure.
