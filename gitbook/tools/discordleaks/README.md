## Description

**DiscordLeaks** is a Unicorn Riot–run web app for searching and browsing leaked chat logs from extremist communities. It exposes message archives (usernames, timestamps, channel context and, where available, attachments) across multiple platforms—primarily **Discord**, with additional corpora for **Rocket.Chat** and **Skype**—to support accountability journalism and research. Typical workflows include pivoting from a server to channels to users, running keyword queries, and using the **Advanced Search** date filters to constrain results. The database is static archival material; Unicorn Riot cautions that logs are published “as‑is” and external links may be risky.

<summary>Purpose, Methodology, and Scope</summary>

**Purpose and Scope:** _DiscordLeaks_ is an online database created by the media collective **Unicorn Riot** to publish leaked chat logs from private Discord servers used by white supremacists and far-right groups. ([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/), [discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja)) Unicorn Riot’s mission is to expose the hidden organizing and communications of these groups as a form of public-interest journalism​([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/)).

Since the 2017 Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally, Unicorn Riot has **obtained hundreds of thousands of Discord messages** from dozens of extremist servers and made them accessible to journalists and researchers​([discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja)).\
As of recent reports, the DiscordLeaks archive hosts **millions of chat posts from over 80 Discord servers** tied to racist and far-right activities (​[unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/)​[unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/)). This initiative is part of Unicorn Riot’s broader “Far-Right Investigations” project aimed at shining light on extremist networks while they believed they were speaking in private​([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/),​[unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/)).

**Methodology:** Unicorn Riot journalists collected these chat logs in the course of investigating hate groups, often by **infiltrating or monitoring private Discord servers** with the help of anonymous sources. ([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/2017/charlottesville-violence-planned-discord-servers-unicorn-riot-reports/)​[github.com](./))

For example, on the eve of the Charlottesville rally (Aug 2017), an informant provided Unicorn Riot with access to Discord planning chats, which the journalists then downloaded as evidence of organized violence​([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/2017/charlottesville-violence-planned-discord-servers-unicorn-riot-reports/),​[unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/2017/charlottesville-violence-planned-discord-servers-unicorn-riot-reports/)). The leaked Discord data is processed by Unicorn Riot’s team—**personal information of targets of harassment is redacted** for safety—and then uploaded in batches to the public _DiscordLeaks_ web app​([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/2017/charlottesville-violence-planned-discord-servers-unicorn-riot-reports/)). All software for the DiscordLeaks platform was developed by Unicorn Riot and volunteer engineers, enabling full-text search and cross-referencing across the leaked chats​([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/),​[unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/)).\
The platform also hosts logs from other chat services (like Rocket. Chat and Skype) that Unicorn Riot obtained during related investigations​([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/)). Unicorn Riot emphasizes that making these primary source materials public enhances understanding of far-right tactics while supporting data journalism efforts​([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/),​[unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/)).

**Limitations Acknowledged:** Unicorn Riot notes that DiscordLeaks is _not an exhaustive record_ of all extremist chatter, only what their team could access ([github.com](./)). The archive is limited to the servers and time frames captured; some chats may be missing if servers were deleted or not fully logged​([github.com](./)). Content from the leaks is published “as-is” – **Unicorn Riot does not alter messages** beyond necessary redactions, so errors or misinformation by the original users remain in the logs​([github.com](./)). The DiscordLeaks site itself issues a **disclaimer about external links**, warning that Unicorn Riot hasn’t vetted any URLs inside the chats (which could be malicious), and advises readers to use caution and anonymity tools when browsing the leaked messages ([discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/user/79759)). In terms of editorial limits, Unicorn Riot has stated they withhold or censor certain details to protect individuals targeted by hate (for instance, they removed identifying info of people whom extremists discussed harming)​([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/2017/charlottesville-violence-planned-discord-servers-unicorn-riot-reports/)).

Overall, Unicorn Riot presents DiscordLeaks as a research tool but cautions that it represents only a snapshot of specific communities and may contain unverified claims or propaganda posted by those users​ ([github.com](./)).

<summary>Investigations and Research Using DiscordLeaks as a Source</summary>

*   **Legal Evidence:** The leaked Discord chats have been used in court proceedings against white supremacists. Notably, attorneys in the[ _Sines v. Kessler_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sines_v._Kessler) civil lawsuit (filed by victims of the Charlottesville violence) submitted Unicorn Riot’s Discord logs as evidence of planners’ intent​

    ([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/far-right-investigations-desk/)). Observers pointed out that discussions in the chats (e.g. about weapons and running over protesters) bolstered claims that the rally organizers conspired to commit violence (​[cjr.org](https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/charlottesville-alt-right-unicorn-riot.php)). Prosecutors in the criminal case against the Charlottesville car attacker, as well as other civil suits, also reviewed the DiscordLeak logs for relevant communications​([cjr.org](https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/charlottesville-alt-right-unicorn-riot.php)). In these ways, Unicorn Riot’s published leaks have directly informed investigations and accountability efforts after far-right violence.
*   **Investigative Journalism:** Many news outlets have **cited DiscordLeaks to expose extremist activities**. For example, _ProPublica_ tapped the Charlottesville Discord chat dump to report how white supremacists joked about vehicular attacks weeks before[ Heather Heyer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Heyer) was killed; while doing so, ProPublica independently verified the identities of at least two users from the leak to confirm the authenticity of the conversations​

    ([propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/white-supremacists-joked-about-using-cars-to-run-over-opponents-before-charlottesville),​ [propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/white-supremacists-joked-about-using-cars-to-run-over-opponents-before-charlottesville)).\
    \&#xNAN;_HuffPost_ journalists used Unicorn Riot’s Discord chats to identify **members of hate groups embedded in institutions** – in 2019 HuffPost revealed 11 U.S. military service members as participants in[ Identity Evropa](https://app.gitbook.com/s/syFo2CguDc8O5VWEVXJP/categories)’s Discord server, after cross-referencing the leaked messages (​[vice.com](https://www.vice.com/en/article/unicorn-riot-outed-a-white-nationalist-in-the-national-guard-but-theyre-not-kicking-him-out/), ​[vice.com](https://www.vice.com/en/article/unicorn-riot-outed-a-white-nationalist-in-the-national-guard-but-theyre-not-kicking-him-out/)). Similarly, local reporters have used DiscordLeaks to link extremists to real-world actions; for instance, chat evidence from the leaks helped journalists document how [Patriot Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Front) members coordinated vandalism and propaganda campaigns nationwide​ ([vice.com](https://www.vice.com/en/article/patriot-front-leaked-chats-porn-habits/), ​[vice.com](https://www.vice.com/en/article/patriot-front-leaked-chats-porn-habits/)).
*   **Academic and Analytical Research:** Scholars and extremism researchers have incorporated the DiscordLeaks dataset into their studies. A 2020 study on far-right online radicalization noted that researchers leveraged _Unicorn Riot’s Discord data from 129 different Discord servers_ to compile narratives of “redpilling” (radicalization) in those communities​

    ([osf.io](https://osf.io/vwnp4/download/)).\
    The large corpus of leaked chats provides rich text for content analysis – for example, researchers have analyzed the language and memes in Identity Evropa’s Discord conversations to understand recruitment and group dynamics​([unicornriot.ninja](https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/neo-nazi-hipsters-identity-evropa-exposed-in-discord-chat-leak/)). Think tanks have also cited DiscordLeaks; for instance, the [**Hedayah** extremism research center](https://hedayah.com/) referenced Unicorn Riot’s Discord archive in discussions of how white supremacists communicate and plan online (​[hedayah.com](https://hedayah.com/app/uploads/2021/09/2021APR1_FINAL_NewZealand_Country-Report.pdf)).
* **Investigative collectives** like _Bellingcat_ have directly mined the data to map networks: Bellingcat’s researchers reported that Unicorn Riot’s archive contained over **760,000 Discord messages (Feb 2017–Mar 2018)** from far-right groups, which they analyzed to track how fascist activists attempted to influence police and community events (​[bellingcat.com](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/08/17/fascist-activists-spent-last-year-trying-win-police/)).
