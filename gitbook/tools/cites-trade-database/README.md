## Description

The tool hosts around [23 million records](https://trade.cites.org/cites_trade_guidelines/en-CITES_Trade_Database_Guide.pdf) of wild fauna and flora trade records. You can look by year ranges, exporting and importing countries, source, purpose, trade terms (live individuals, skins, etc.) and taxon (genus, species, etc).

You can configurate the kind of results you will get. You can get a csv report with customized configurations or a web version.&#x20;

For example, if you are looking for China imports of wild species for biomedical purposes from 2018 to 2023, you will get a detailed table with over 100 results that gives you species info, importer and exporter info, reported quantity, purpose, source, among other findings.

The tool allows you to bulk download the whole database. With a relatively fast internet connection (145.9 Mbps download and 9.92 Mbps upload when I tried) you can get it in under 2 minutes. It is divided into csv archives.

The tool also links to the [CITES Wildlife TradeView](https://tradeview.cites.org/en), a interactive online tool for exploring and visualising CITES trade data. You can explore visuals provided in a global view (data of all CITES-listed species), country view (data for one or more countries) and taxon view (data for one or more species or taxonomic groups).

I reviewed the 2025.1 version.

## Limitations

There are some studies that expose some tool limitations, including from the CITES Secretariat.&#x20;

At a CITES [meeting](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/69/E-SC69-28-02.pdf) it was noted that with the current functions of the platform it is not possible to analyze trade patterns including, for example, whether a specimen was found in one large shipment or in multiple small shipments or whether the specimen was shipped together with other specimens. A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718303045) on the limitations of CITES described, among other results, that 96% of the records are not complete, and that three-quarters of the data do not have the quantities of importers or exporters. Among some of the important results of another [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720309757) it was found that more than one-third of the species had a different category of traded volume and that the number of shipments did not reflect traded volume in 15% of vertebrate species.

## Ethical Considerations

None so far.
