Users can search the database easily, and every item provides a link back to the original source. Each ordnance item in Bulletpicker has its own page, typically including technical diagrams, real-life images (if available), and a written overview.

### Key Areas&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
TIP: Because the website contains a vast repository of resources, users can use the search function on the top left for keywords.
{% endhint %}

The contents are organized into the following categories, accessible through the navigation menu on the left side of the page.&#x20;

1.[ Library](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_library.html) - This section is a collection of manuals from different armed forces (including historical manuals)&#x20;

2\. [Fillers](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_explosives.html) - this section contains resources on various fillers, defined as the[ "energetic material (propellants, explosives, or pyrotechnic mixes)" contained inside military munitions.](https://www.denix.osd.mil/uxo/explosives-safety/faqs/#faq-1) These are the explosive materials packed inside an ordnance and are the substances that do the job of creating the explosion. Contents are organized in alphabetical order by name of the explosive agent and contain technical information.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/2025-05-02_19-48-10-ed.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Information (if available) on fillers are organized as follows: Other Names, Use, Sources. (Image credit: Bulletpicker.com) </p></figcaption></figure>

3\. [Ordnance](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_ord.html) - This section contains a list of various weapon systems, along with a brief introduction to each system. If you are new to the subject matter, it is recommended to start by exploring the “General Information” tab before moving on to more technical sections.&#x20;

Each type of ordnance has a subcategory _organized by country._&#x20;

**For example:**&#x20;

Users interested in resources related to Ukrainian ordnance can follow the steps as follows:&#x20;

_Ordnance → Bombs → Ukraine_&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/2025-05-02_18-29-44.png" alt="" width="246"><figcaption><p>This is the navigation pane of the website, located to the left. This shows a sample navigation for a user interested in researching Ukrainian ordnance. Note that the contents are mainly those found in the public domain. </p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/2025-05-02_20-16-20-ed.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is a quick guide we created for navigating information on various ordnance listed on the website. Note that not all types of ordnance have information on each of these categories. Some do not have images, and some do not have information on how they function or information on hazardous content. Also note that sometimes items will contain just a diagram and no real-life photo, or just a real-life photo with no diagram. Sometimes, these items contain both. This example can be found on: <a href="https://www.bulletpicker.com/landmine_-apers_-m2a4.html">https://www.bulletpicker.com/landmine_-apers_-m2a4.html</a> </p></figcaption></figure>

Information on ballistic properties ([how weapons behave as they are launched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics)) can be found under "description" or "functioning." &#x20;

4\. [Fuzes](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_fuze.html) -  According to this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuze), a fuze is a “device with explosive components designed to initiate the main charge” and determines when the explosion happens. This section of the website lists various types of fuzes which are categorized by country. Some types contain a short description, an image, a short description of its function, hazardous components, if any, - for example [here](https://www.bulletpicker.com/adapter-booster_-m102a1.html). Also note that sometimes items will contain just a diagram and no real-life photo, or just a real-life photo with no diagram. Sometimes, these items contain both.&#x20;

The content is organized by type of ordnance in which the fuze is used, and then followed by a subcategory organized by country.&#x20;

**For example:**

_Fuzes → Bombs, Clusters and Dispensers → France_

* **Technical Reference (with caveats):** Although the site explicitly states that it is not for identification or instruction by unqualified individuals, trained specialists may use it as one reference point among others. For those with foundational knowledge or who have professional qualifications,  this tool may be helpful because it provides data such as:
  * Hazardous components, if available&#x20;
  * Chemical composition of a filler
  * Ballistic properties&#x20;
  * [Manufacturing markings](https://www.bulletpicker.com/rocket_-57mm-heat_frag_-s-5kpb.html) and [Cross-sectional diagrams](https://www.bulletpicker.com/rocket-motor_-68mm_-model-f1.html)

Based on the disclaimers and the technical nature of the subject matter (Ordnance, Explosives), navigating and understanding the information on Bulletpicker.com might require some prior knowledge or a careful approach. Beginner users without a background in this area should exercise extreme caution and know the site's limitations.

## Requirements

* A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
* PDF Reader

## Limitations

[**The tool’s homepage explicitly states several limitations:**](https://www.bulletpicker.com/index.html)

* The content is not for Demining, Unexploded Ordnance (UXO), or  Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) information.
* Not designed to teach EOD/UXO technicians or deminers.
* Not designed to identify UXO or ordnance.
* Content is not for identification or instructional purposes for unqualified individuals.
* Does not replace qualified specialists.
* Users are responsible for verifying content with other official references.
* Bulletpicker, LLC is not associated with the DoD or the US Government.
* Bulletpicker, LLC does not handle classified Government documents or data.
* Proximity to UXO is always dangerous and should be avoided; only trained personnel should handle it.

Based on our review, here are additional limitations:

1. Foundational knowledge required&#x20;

The content of Bulletpicker.com is intended for those with a foundational background on military weapons systems. Beginner users will not find introductory content. It is not designed for beginner users, and assumes they possess foundational knowledge of ordnance terminology and identification.&#x20;

2. Content Variability:&#x20;

Information depth and organization vary across the different sections of the website, possibly due to the reliance on public domain materials and sources with expired copyrights. This creates noticeable inconsistencies in coverage.

For example, [the Ordnance/Bombs subcategory ](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_bombs.html)includes resources for 13 countries, while the [“Clusters and Dispensers” subcategory](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_clusters.html) covers eight countries plus an “unknown” category.&#x20;

According to the tool provider, variation in content is due to several reasons, including: (1) Many documents exist but are classified as “For Official Use Only” (FOUO), making their distribution illegal. (2) Documents that appear on document hosting websites, such as Scribd or archive.org, are not allowed to be posted on the website, as this can result in immediate legal issues from authorities. (3) [The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) also strictly control the sharing of military and defence-related information or “technical data”  ](https://www.varonis.com/blog/itar-compliance)without special permission.&#x20;

Another example is that not all items will contain an image or diagram.&#x20;

According to the tool provider, this is because some images are classified as sensitive materials, have poor image quality, or require time management due to the massive volume of submissions received.&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

Given the sensitive nature of the information (ordnance and explosives), users should consider the ethical implications of how they use this information. It should not be used for any illegal or harmful activities. Respecting the disclaimers and limitations of the site is imperative.&#x20;

## Guide

None at the moment.
