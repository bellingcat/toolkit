## Description

A Chinese database providing information about Chinese companies. The database provides data obtained from various Chinese authority websites (e.g., [National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System](https://www.gsxt.gov.cn/), [China Court Judgment Documents Network](https://english.court.gov.cn/2024-02/28/c_965997.htm)), as well as enforcement notices.

**Search by Enterprise:**&#x20;

Users can apply various search criteria (as seen in the screenshot below), such as:

* Search by Enterprise ("企业名称") &#x20;
* Search by Legal Shareholder ("法定代表人")
* Search by Industry ("经营范围")
* Search by Geographical Cities ("热门城市")

Alternatively, you can also simply type different search terms in the search box and apply search filters afterwards.

**Search by Enterprise ("企业名称"):**&#x20;

If you have a particular enterprise in mind, you can input it into the search bar. For greater accuracy, search terms should be in Chinese.

The search results starts with listings that match the name of the company but they also show companies with similar names.&#x20;

The status of enterprises are colour coded. For example, the status of active enterprises is displayed in green, with the words "存续" ("existing"). The status of de-registered companies is displayed in orange, with the words "注销" ("de-registered").

When you click on a search result, it will bring you to the details of the enterprise. Details include enterprise name, name of legal shareholder ("法定代表人"), date of company establishment ("成立时间") etc.

**Search by Industry:**

You can search for enterprises by industry. For instance, in this example below, the filter "房地厂业" ("property development") was applied, allowing results related to property development enterprises to be listed below. You can add more filters to refine your results further (e.g., filtering by geographical regions).

Alternatively, you can also choose from a list of industrial sectors ("按行业查询") by scrolling down from the main landing page.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

The usage of a Chinese translation tool (e.g. DeepL) can be useful.

## Limitations

Not all search returned information will be displayed if you do not log in with a registered account (which would require a Chinese mobile number) as non-registered account users would have basic search functions (as elaborated in the article). While creating a registered account is free, this would require a Chinese mobile number.&#x20;

Search results displayed without logging in with a registered account would not provide all the data that is available. For more comprehensive results, it is advisable to cross-check with other similar websites (e.g., Tianyancha, Qichacha).

Depending on your internet connection, the website may not turn up results on first search. It is advisable to try and refresh the webpage again - this step usually returns search results.

## Ethical Considerations

Since data is publicly available and sourced from government records, users can use this tool without ethical concerns. Information on companies and individuals must not be exploited for personal gain, doxxing, harassment, or any actions that may be deemed illegal or unlawful.
