## Description

Who Posted What enables users to conduct keyword searches within a designated time period on Facebook. This can be useful since Facebook doesn't support searches within a specific time frame.

Various searches can be conducted via options provided by Who Posted What. Some categories use a user ID (UID) for the searches to be conducted. A Facebook UID is a unique numeric identifier assigned to each user profile. Some profile URLs must be put in the “Get ID” bar of the tool to get a UID. However, many profiles have their UID at the end of the URL (highlighted in bold): https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=**100094902271869** (= the Facebook account of the "Sindh Information Commission"). The same applies to location UIDs.

A search can be:

1. A keyword on a specific day: “Ukraine” on February 4, 2020. A new tab will open on Facebook showing posts related to Ukraine on Feb. 4 of 2020.
2. A keyword search for a specific month: “Barack Obama” from “September 2020.” The new tab opens with relevant results.
3. A keyword search for a specific year: “coronavirus” from “2019.” For 2019 there are no results for coronavirus. But when we change the year to 2020, the results are abundant, since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020.
4. Timerange: This option allows users to search for keywords within a specific time period, for example for posts about “Emmanuel Macron” from August 22, 2019 to February 20, 2021.
5. Location: Search for posts about “Mark Kelly” at the location ID “105540216147364” which corresponds to Phoenix, Arizona.
6. “Posts directly from/Posts associated with”: This search query allows you to find posts which include specific keywords from a particular user account. Copy and paste "https://www.facebook.com/narendramodi” into the bar under “Get ID.” The Facebook UID of the Indian prime minister is “100044527235621.” Select “post from” or “posts associated with” from the drop down options. Enter “100044527235621” into "Posts from"_,_ then “mosque” into "about." A new tab on Facebook opens, showing Modi’s posts about mosques.
