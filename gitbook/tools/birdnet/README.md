## Description

BirdNET LiveMap is an online interactive map that displays bird sound detections and the associated bird species from around the world in near real time. &#x20;

As part of a wider research project to use computers to learn and identify bird sounds, the LiveMap aggregates anonymized user-inputted data and bird recordings, displaying results of bird sightings across the world from the last 24 hours.

Additionally the LiveMap provides a list of recent sightings along with hourly observations and number of species observed, along with the most frequently observed birds for Europe and North America, with plans to expand the geographical remit.

It is based on data of sound recordings provided through the [BirdNET app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/birdnet/id1541842885) which can be uploaded by any user. Users in turn can use the app to ID birds based on machine learning of common bird species.

The LiveMap is intended to be used by scientists and researchers for monitoring species.

The LiveMap also displays the total number of observations, the number of observations in the last 24 hours, the number of species identified, the number of users in the last 24 hours and other details.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

The LiveMap is free to use with no sign up requirements.

## Limitations

The location data provided is on the basis of user input which might not always be accurate. The map also does not provide exact coordinates so detections are shown only approximately.

Some regions or areas are only sparsely covered due to low numbers of users.

Accuracy of identification may vary depending on the sound quality of the recording provided.

Detailed metadata and raw audio are not available making it difficult to conduct a detailed analysis.

## Ethical Considerations

The LiveMap anonymizes the user details of all data entry points provided.&#x20;

It states that it [generates a random user ID](https://birdnet.cornell.edu/privacy-policy/) to identify user devices inputting data via the app and stores this data for research purposes only.
