## Description

Snap Map is a Snapchat feature that places publicly shared Snaps on an interactive map. When a user shares a Story to “Our Story”, Snapchat tags that media with a location so it appears on the map. You can zoom in and out, then click on the coloured hotspots to view the posts associated with that location.

You can open Snap Map in the Snapchat mobile app or in a web browser at map.snapchat.com. Both versions let you explore cities and landmarks, search by keyword, and view user-generated videos and photos from public events. Layers include “My Places” and themed views for events or trends.

Investigators use Snap Map to understand real-time situations such as protests, natural disasters, or large gatherings by reviewing short clips uploaded by people on the ground.

**Access Snap Maps**: Open the Snapchat app on your mobile device and click the location icon in the bottom left corner of the screen to access Snap Maps.&#x20;

**Explore Locations**: Once on Snap Maps, users can explore different locations by zooming in and out on the map.

**View Snaps**: Snap Map posts appear as hot spots on a heat map. Users can click on the colored dots on the map to view public posts that are tagged as being posted from that location. The warmer the color of the hot spot, the more Snap Maps are being posted there.&#x20;

**Filter Content**: Use the search bar in the upper-right corner to filter content by keywords. For example, if you're researching a specific event or topic, you can search for relevant keywords to find related Snaps.

**Discover Specific Locations:** Certain locations, such as museums, restaurants, and universities, are automatically displayed on the heat map. Users can also zoom in on the map to locate these locations and view public posts that have been geotagged to that specific place.&#x20;

**Use Cases:** Snap Maps can be a useful tool for gathering geospatial information and understanding real-time events.&#x20;

Snap Maps is also a good starting point for investigations into human networks in specific locations. Snap Map posts are linked to a specific Snapchat user, allowing other users to click on them and view the user's public profile. The public profile may include the user's Snapchat username, bio, and other publicly visible posts.&#x20;

## Cost

* [x] Free
* [ ] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

Viewing public Snaps on Snap Map is free. Snapchat’s paid Snap+ subscription is optional and not required for Snap Map.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

Basic map navigation and playback. Finding relevant posts can take time in low-activity areas.

## Requirements

* Internet connection.
* **Mobile app:** A Snapchat account with a verified email or phone number to access Snap Map.
* **Web:** Public heat-map stories can be viewed at map.snapchat.com without logging in. Saving places or posting your own Snaps requires a Snapchat account.
* Location services must be enabled to contribute your own Snaps. Ghost Mode hides your location from friends, but Snapchat still processes location data per its policy.

## Limitations

* **Data availability varies:** Content appears only where users have recently posted; rural or restricted areas may be sparse.
* **Limited filtering:** Search is keyword-based; no sorting by date, time or specific username unless you are friends with that user.
* **Temporary posts:** Most Snaps remain visible for about 24 hours; some may persist longer, depending on your privacy settings.
* **Possible inaccuracies:** User-generated posts may contain incorrect location tags or lack sufficient context.
* **Country availability:** Snap Map may be restricted in certain jurisdictions; availability is subject to change. Check current access.
* **No built-in archive:** There is no native export; capture references while viewing if you need to preserve content

## Ethical Considerations

* Posts may include personal data and precise locations. Protect privacy and avoid doxxing or harassment.
* Minors and vulnerable people may appear in content. Share and handle responsibly.
* Some posts may be graphic or sensitive before moderation.
* Ghost Mode reduces visibility to friends, but does not mean no location processing. Always consider consent and safety.
