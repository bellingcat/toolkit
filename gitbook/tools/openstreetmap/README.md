## Description

OpenStreetMap is an open-source, open-license online map created and maintained by an online community. Users contribute to the map by adding locations and updating location data. The tool allows for location searching as well as directions. OSM includes tools and communities designed for humanitarian mapping by NGOs or individuals.

## Cost

* [x] Free
* [ ] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid



## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

Users must log in or sign up to use Open Street Map.

## Limitations

OSM's place names are crowdsourced, so they may not always be accurate. Additionally, locations can be difficult to search if the place name was entered in a different language (for example, the localized name versus an anglicized version).

## Ethical Considerations

OpenStreetMap receives funds from corporate entities such as Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Meta.
