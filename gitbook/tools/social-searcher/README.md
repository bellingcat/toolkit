## Ethical Considerations

Social Searcher[ only accesses publicly available posts](https://www.social-searcher.com/about/). Informed consent may be required when quoting posts from identifiable individuals. Even public posts can carry ethical concerns if the data is used out of context or in ways the poster wouldnâ€™t expect, and special attention needs to be paid to protecting the identities of private citizens, minors, and vulnerable groups.

The platform states that it does not engage in the collection, storage, or scraping of data from any social media websites and that it does not access private user content or utilize either official or unofficial APIs.
