## Description

OpenSecrets is a nonpartisan, independent, and nonprofit organization tracking money in U.S. politics and its impact on elections and public policy. The page has four main categories: Candidates & Officeholders, Elections & Fundraising Data, Industries & Interest Groups, and Lobbying.

**Candidates & Officeholders - this section is divided into five subsections:**

* [Candidates & Officeholders Overview ](https://www.opensecrets.org/candidates-officeholders)- this section includes lists on current and former individuals who held political positions on federal and state level in the U.S. - judicial officeholders, governors, state commissioners, members of congress. The data is presented as lists with the name of the individual, the state they represent and their current position.
* [Members of Congress ](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress)- lists the names of current and past members of congress, including new ones joining and outgoing ones and shows how much they have managed to fundraise for their campaigns and how much they have spent so far.

* Each name on the list is hyperlinked to a separate profile with additional spending and fundraising data, including names of donors.

* This section also includes spending by Leadership [PAC](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/what-is-a-pac)s (Political Action Committees). Each PAC is hyperlinked to a separate profile with additional spending by party and by election cycle.
* [Congressional Committees](https://www.opensecrets.org/cong-cmtes) - shows cumulative donation data to each committee broken down by industry.
* [Presidential Administrations ](https://www.opensecrets.org/presidential-administrations)- a deep dive into the three most recent administrations with articles, reports, names of appointees by the administrations. Each profile contains different information and the administrations only include the Biden, the Trump and the Obama administrations.
* [Personal Finances](https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances) - ranks members of congress by richest and poorest by their own income, net worth, financial liabilities and assets. Each name is hyperlinked to a profile with additional information.

**Elections & Fundraising Data - this section includes spending by candidates in presidential and congressional elections.** The two most relevant subsections are:

* [Outside Spending](https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending) - data reported by outside spending groups to the Federal Election Commission. There is a separate section devoted to dark money groups – politically active nonprofits that aren't required to publicly disclose their donors. The information includes data on political recipients, however it only shows the amounts received and rarely the donors.
* [Donor Lookup ](https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup)- a search by name of a donor - these are individuals and companies. This is the most user-friendly and useful feature for small investigations as it allows searching by keyword.   &#x20;

**Industries & Interest Groups - political action committees, industries, non-governmental organizations who spend money to support political candidates and issues**

* [Political Ads ](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-ads)- allows tracking of political spending online (Facebook and Google) by advertiser and each advertiser has its own separate profile with specifics (Including which Facebook pages ran the ads); and by TV and Radio - contains pdf files submitted to the Federal Communications Commission by broadcasters around the country.
* [Dark Money](https://www.opensecrets.org/dark-money) - sub-page with articles on dark money as well as who spent [dark money](https://www.opensecrets.org/dark-money/basics) and where that dark money went.
* [Industries](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries) - cumulative data on which industries spent money. Also for each interest group there is a summary of political giving dating back to the 1990 election cycle (breakdowns by type of contribution & political party top contributors); a list of organizations (usually U.S. companies) that have given the most from that industry through their employees and political action committees; a list of candidates that have received the most from a particular industry.
* [Organizations](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/all-profiles) - Each organization profile tracks campaign contributions from the organization's employees and members, its PAC and from the organization itself, only when it gives to outside groups. Each profile also tracks the organization’s lobbying activity to influence public policy, as well as its outside spending to influence elections.
* [527s](https://www.opensecrets.org/527s) - groups, formed under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, primarily are involved in issue advocacy. Some organizations, including labor unions, use 527 accounts to support or oppose state and local candidates and contribute to other committees. The data is presented as simple lists with contributors' names and amounts.
* [PACs ](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs)- includes data in Super PACs and leadership PACs. This subsection is useful when tracking whether a candidate received money for a specifically formed action committee dedicated to them and whether a PAC has donated to more than one candidate. Information like this can uncover links between donor spending and political issues they might want to achieve through funding a candidate.
* [Issue Profiles ](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/issues/)- OpenSecrets' own research on specific topics with lots of articles and data. For example the climate change issue delves deep into spending, environmental groups activism and environmental lobbying.

**Lobbying - Companies, labor unions, trade associations and other influential organizations' spending on Congress and federal agencies to lobby for special interests.**

* [Lobbying Overview ](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying)- includes top lobbying contracts, agencies, issues lobbied, bills that lobbyists worked on, contracts between lobbying firms and companies. Also allows to search by name:

* [Foreign Lobby Watch ](https://www.opensecrets.org/fara)- uses the semi-annual reports foreign agents are required to file with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) to calculate the countries with the highest spending. Allows search by country and the results provide detailed information on which companies and individuals spent money on lobbying and advocacy.

* [Revolving Door](https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving-door): database documenting the individuals who have worked in both the public sector and lobbying firms and may have conflicts of interest. Allows search by name of individuals, congressional committees, lobbying firms, or employment positions. This submenu can be used to research which PR or lobbying firms have hired former staffers of the White House, congressional or house committees, or which former members of the House or the Congress are lobbying for particular interests.&#x20;
