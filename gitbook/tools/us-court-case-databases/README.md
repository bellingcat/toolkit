## Limitations

Certain case information is not publicly available, such as juvenile records or cases involving protective and restraining orders. Additionally, cases older than \~2010 might not be digitized — if you find yourself in this situation, you can make a records request to the respective county to recieve scanned copies of the records you're looking for.&#x20;

There are aggregate tools that attempt to search civil and criminal databases nation-wide and give you the information all in one place. While this can be a good starting point, beware that none of these tools are comprehensive. If you want to perform a proper check, you should check the actual databases.
