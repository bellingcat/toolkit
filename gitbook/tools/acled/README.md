## Description

ACLED provides detailed, up-to-date information on political violence and protest events worldwide. The toolset includes the [ACLED Explorer](https://acleddata.com/platform/explorer), [Trendfinder](https://acleddata.com/platform/trendfinder), [Conflict Alert System (CAST)](https://acleddata.com/platform/cast-conflict-alert-system), and a [Conflict Exposure Calculator](https://acleddata.com/platform/conflict-exposure-calculator), allowing users to track, analyze, and forecast conflict dynamics. Users can download datasets and utilize interactive dashboards for in-depth analysis of trends, country-specific profiles, and more. Covering **all countries and territories**, ACLED’s data supports research, humanitarian, and policy applications by enabling users to observe conflict patterns, identify trends, and assess regional stability risks.

* **Timely Data:** A detailed dataset on the dates, locations, actors, and fatalities of political violence and protests, updated weekly.
* [**Analysis reports**](https://acleddata.com/analysis/): Written reports by ACLED analysts and researchers based on ACLED data.
* **Analysis Tools:** Interactive dashboards, trend reports, and maps visualizing conflict data over time and across regions.
* **Country Profiles:** In-depth reports on specific countries, analyzing conflict dynamics and historical context.
* **Data Export:** Downloadable datasets in various formats for custom analysis.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some functions or Dashboards within ACLED (such as CAST) might not work with an Ad- or tracking-blocker or on browsers with very strict security settings. The author's research doesn't indicate that this is of high concern, but you're responsible for your own digital footprint. You can download monthly reports for most of the tools, or use a VM to connect to ACLED if you want to avoid switching off these tools on your computer.

## **Features**

### **Data**

* [**Data export tool**](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/)**:** Weekly updated conflict and protest data, as well as[ curated datasets.](https://acleddata.com/curated-data-files/)
* [**ACLED Explorer**](https://acleddata.com/explorer/): Filters data by location, actor, and event type, with exportable tables and charts. Still the quickest route to map/table/chart views and CSV/XLS downloads of the full 1997-present archive.
* [**Early Warning Dashboard**](https://acleddata.com/early-warning/dashboard/) **(2025-)** – ACLED has merged Trendfinder into a revamped Early Warning Dashboard that now houses all four risk tools (Trendfinder, CAST, Conflict Exposure Calculator and Conflict Index) behind a single login. A shared header lets you set date range, geography and actor/event filters once and carry them across modules; a new dark-mode toggle improves readability during night-shift monitoring or presentations.

## Limitations

The ACLED dataset and tools come with several limitations that researchers should be aware of before deciding to utilize them in their projects:

* **Geographical Coverage**: While ACLED covers all countries worldwide, there may be gaps in coverage, especially in regions with less accessible information or ongoing conflicts.
* **Data Updates**: Though ACLED regularly updates its dataset, there can be a lag in reporting certain events due to the time required to verify information. This might affect research that requires the most current data.
* **Resolution and Granularity**: The level of detail and granularity of data can vary by location and event, potentially impacting analyses that require uniform detail across datasets.
* **Access Restrictions**: Some detailed data or analysis tools may be available only to users with specific access levels, limiting the scope of research for those with basic access.
* **Dependence on Open Sources**: The quality and reliability of ACLED data is dependent on the availability and veracity of open sources. In regions where the media is restricted or unreliable, this could impact the accuracy of the dataset.
* _**Conflict Alert System (CAST):**_ As a future forecasting system, it comes with caveats regarding accuracy. To understand more, see the methodology [here](https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2023/07/ACLED-CAST-Methodology-%E2%80%93-July-2023.pdf). CAST forecasts are indicative and should not be treated as certainties.

Researchers should consider these limitations alongside their research goals and methodologies to determine whether ACLED's tools and datasets suit their needs.

## Ethical Considerations

When using ACLED's tools and datasets, researchers must navigate several ethical considerations to ensure responsible utilization and dissemination of sensitive information. Users are advised to consult ACLED's [Terms of Use](https://acleddata.com/terms-of-use/) for detailed guidelines.

* **Data Misinterpretation**: There is a risk that data could be misinterpreted or taken out of context, potentially leading to harmful conclusions or actions. Researchers must strive for accuracy and clarity in their analyses.
* **Bias and Representation**: It's essential to acknowledge biases in data collection and reporting processes and understand how they may affect the representation of certain groups or incidents.
* **Ethical Use and Attribution**: Users of ACLED data should use the data ethically, including proper attribution and acknowledgment of ACLED as the data source, and should not use the data for purposes that could incite violence or conflict. Users must follow ACLED’s End User License Agreement, content‑usage terms, and attribution policy when reusing the data.

Researchers and users of ACLED data are encouraged to engage with these ethical considerations thoughtfully, ensuring their work contributes positively to global understanding and rthe esolution of international conflicts.
