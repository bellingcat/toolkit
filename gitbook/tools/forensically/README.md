## Description

This collection of web-based tools is used for verifying images. Each tool's name reflects its function: Magnifier, Clone Detection, Noise Analysis, Error Level Analysis, Meta Data, Geo Tags, etc.

The Clone Detection feature, for instance, spots similar areas within an image. This can mean that someone might have copied some features from the picture and has pasted to another area in the image. For example, clouds in the sky might have been cloned to make the sky look more cloudy.

Users can test images for authenticity with the C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) Content Analysis feature. C2PA embeds metadata about their [origins and history](https://c2pa.org/) into photos, videos, and audio. This standard enables users to [authenticate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2024-03-c2pa-verification-news-journalism-credentials) and differentiate real media from fake by providing genuine provenance information.

Forensically requires experience to fully understand each tool's function. For those new to OSINT verification techniques, watching the tutorial by the founder, Jonas Wagner, may be useful.

## Requirements

The tool does not have any requirements for its usage.

## Limitations

Open source researchers should never only rely on Forensically to determine whether a photo has been manipulated. The tool can provide misleading results and it can also be challenging to interpret the results.

If images are stripped of their metadata, the tool “Meta Data” on Forensically cannot be used to read the metadata of images downloaded from social media. Most images downloaded from social media have their metadata removed.
