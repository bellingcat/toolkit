## Description

The Police Record Access Project is a [publicly searchable database](https://clean.calmatters.org/about) containing previously confidential records on shootings by law enforcement officers, law enforcement misconduct, and serious uses of force in the State of California. The tool aims to [provide transparency](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/police-records-access-project-searchable-database-law-enforcement-transparency) into some of the statewide law enforcement records. It was made possible by California’s transparency laws (SB 1421 and SB 16). This centralized database also solves the challenge of having to file a public records request via numerous individual agencies to receive this type of information.

_**Where is the data from?**_

Since 2019, members of the [California Reporting Project](https://projects.scpr.org/california-reporting-project/) have requested data from [“nearly 700 law enforcement agencies”](https://clean.calmatters.org/about) in California.

[According to the tool provider](https://clean.calmatters.org/about), these agencies include:&#x20;

* Police departments
* Sheriff departments
* Public school and university police forces
* California Highway Patrol
* Prison
* Probation departments
* District attorneys
* California Attorney General’s office
* Coroners
* Medical examiners
* Oversight boards and commissions
* Other California government agencies &#x20;

_**What types of records are available?**_&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Graphic Content Warning:** Items may contain disturbing images, videos, or descriptions
{% endhint %}

The records are wide-ranging. According to the [tool provider](https://clean.calmatters.org/about) (paragraph 2), they include, among others: Investigative reports, autopsy reports, written transcripts of law enforcement officers' interviews, video interviews of law enforcement officers, photographs, investigative hearings, and body-cam footage. In addition, our tests show that the records also include meeting minutes from different police commissions. &#x20;

_**How was the database built and categorized?**_&#x20;

According to the tool providers’ [methodology](https://clean.calmatters.org/about) (paragraph 3), the database was built using technologies such as generative AI, coupled with a manual review of a subset of cases per year.&#x20;

Each record is labeled in a neutral manner, indicating only a date and who provided the documents.&#x20;

**Example:** 2/18/2024 - Documents provided by the San Diego Police Department, San Diego County&#x20;

\
The broad categories of included cases are Force, Shooting, and Misconduct.  These are defined by the tool providers [as follows](https://clean.calmatters.org/about#Methodology):&#x20;

* **FORCE:** “Police use-of-force incidents causing 'great bodily injury' or death”;
* **SHOOTING:** “Police shootings, fatal or not, including accidental and missed shots”;
* **MISCONDUCT:** “Sustained findings by agencies that an officer committed specific types of misconduct, including sexual assault, excessive force, dishonesty, prejudical action, unlawful arrest, and unlawful search”.

{% hint style="success" %}
Note: Each record/case can belong to ONE OR ALL three categories.&#x20;

### How to Use the Database

_**Where To Access**_

According to this [StanfordReport article](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/police-records-access-project-searchable-database-law-enforcement-transparency), the database is free to access through the websites of CalMatters and its partner news organizations:&#x20;

* CalMatters - [https://clean.calmatters.org/](https://clean.calmatters.org/)&#x20;
* KQED - [https://policerecords.kqed.org/](https://policerecords.kqed.org/)
* LA Times - [https://clean.latimes.com/](https://clean.latimes.com/)
* San Francisco Chronicle - [https://clean.sfchronicle.com/](https://clean.sfchronicle.com/)&#x20;

_**How To Search**_

The search functionality is straightforward to use. The key features are keyword search, filter, and viewing records as PDF:

1. Keyword search: Users can perform a general search for officer names, locations or specific terms.
2. Filters: Search can be refined by

* County: Based on our tests, the records have been categorized from approximately 56 out of the [58 counties](https://www.counties.org/counties/) in California.&#x20;
* Law enforcement agency
* Case type&#x20;
* Date range

_**How to View and Search Specific Records**_

Each case provides access to the original, redacted PDF documents. Each case can contain more than one document, and each document can contain several pages. Users can search through all documentes related to a case by using a dedicated search bar.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/unknown (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>When clicking on a specific search result, users are shown the list of documents associated with that case. Note the search bar that searches documents specific to the case in question. </p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: Users can also cross check search results with the [National Police Index](https://national.cpdp.co/state/California) of California to look up further info about officers.

## Limitations&#x20;

* Although the database is updated every 24 hours it currently only contains records from 2015 to 2023.&#x20;
* The dataset does not include all use-of-force cases. Only two types of use-of-force incidents are covered in the database:
  * Discharge of a weapon at a person by police (excluding tasers, paintball guns, or other weapons using less lethal ammunition).
  * Police uses of force resulting in death or “great bodily injury.”
* The database also does not include all allegations of police misconduct. It only contains cases of “sustained” findings of sexual assault, excessive force, dishonesty, prejudical action, unlawful arrest, and unlawful search or where an officer was accused of those actions and left the agency before the investigation was completed.
* Some of the sensitive content has been redacted. Records where government agencies failed to redact personally identifying sensitive information are not listed in search results and some cases will display no files where those files have sensitive information.
* Searches can miss relevant documents if different terminology is used (e.g., “taser” vs. “electronic control weapon”). Users should always review the underlying government records.
* There is a time lag as police agencies must conclude an investigation before it is added to the database.&#x20;
* Some records may be added after an investigation into a police shooting is closed and the agencies release the requested records.
* A successful public records request must be completed to access some _**\[@afton not clear here what gets auto included and what doesn't]**_ of the data.
* Some information may appear in multiple files.
* Images, video and audio from incidents is not included.
* There is no immediately visible graphic content warning. The warning sign is small and not easy to find.&#x20;
* There is a caveat in the below image indicating that the search results may not necessarily identify all relevant documents/cases. Search results may also have incomplete information and that users should verify information found in the database. &#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/2025-09-21_21-18-37-limitation.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is a caveat at the bottom of the main search results - and a graphic content warning that is not easy to find.</p></figcaption></figure>

* Be aware that records may change or be updated: "Information about a case can change as agencies submit new or updated records" is specified on the top of the search bar.&#x20;
* The tool shows a limitation in how it records or displays dates, since it is unclear whether the date provided refers to the incident, the request, or another point in time. For example, [one record](https://clean.calmatters.org/cases/1743019578959-kdy) lists the date as October 31, 2023, but the[ underlying document](https://cleanpdfs.blob.core.windows.net/pdfs/74/28/04/742804475f8535e404fa8eae232a8b80d1cf31f6) cites an incident date of September 2014. This inconsistency makes it difficult to determine which event the system’s listed date is actually tied to, reducing clarity and reliability for users reviewing case information.

## Ethical Considerations&#x20;

* Privacy and harm - although victim data is redacted it may still be possible to identify a victim though the incident itself so caution should be exercised in how the data is used. &#x20;
* Some documents contain text or images some people might consider sensitive or disturbing.
* Accuracy - possible errors in data mean that any data should be independently verified.
