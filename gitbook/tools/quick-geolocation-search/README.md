## Description

Quick Geolocation Search is a repository of various maps, all in one place, which allows researchers to look at the same location on several maps.

Enter coordinates in the longitude and latitude fields, or select a location on the map and choose a map you are interested in. The map will open in a new tab.

Categories include **General** maps such as Google Maps, Yandex, Open Street Map, and Wikimapia.

Other categories to explore are History, Nature, Satellite, Transport, Social Media.

PastVu, under the **History** maps category, for instance, allows users to explore historical photos from 1886 to 2000 displayed on an interactive map, from locations across the globe.

Some maps from the **Nature** category are: Light Pollution Map, Shadow Map, SunCal, and FIRMS. The [Light Pollution Map](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/help.html) “displays light pollution related content over Microsoft Bing base layers (road and hybrid Bing maps).” Shadow Map lets a user visualize sunlight and shadows in a 3D setting at any point in time and place. SunCalc visualizes the sun’s path at any date and time for a given location. See more about SunCalc [here](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/suncalc). [FIRMS by NASA](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/nasa-firms) lets users explore active fire data.

The **Satellite** maps section features [Sentinel Hub also known as Copernicus Browser](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/sentinal-hub-playground), and Virtual Globetrotting. Both can be used for exploring satellite imagery from across the globe. Virtual Globetrotting can be used to view high-resolution imagery of landmarks, and much more!

[Marine Traffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:2.514/centery:48.336/zoom:13) in the **Transport** section, maps and tracks the positions of shipping vessels across the globe.

Quick Geolocation Search also features **tools** that lets users "[draw on map and share](https://gribrouillon.fr/?sid=F6wMVp7o56#10/48.2100/2.2800)" the location of your choice.
