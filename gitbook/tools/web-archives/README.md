(current version: 7.0.4, August 2025)

## Description

Web Archives is a browser extension that allows you to view archived and cached versions of web pages on [archiving sites](https://github.com/dessant/web-archives/wiki/Search-engines) such as the [Wayback Machine](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/internet-archive) and [archive.today](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/archive.today).&#x20;

By integrating multiple services into one interface, the extension can help save time and enhance efficiency during online investigations.

**Example use case:** You are investigating a website that frequently updates its content or might remove sensitive pages. Web Archives enables you to quickly check archived versions from different platforms to track changes or retrieve deleted content.

## How to use

You can start searches directly from the context menu or the browser toolbar.&#x20;

### Fetch the archives of a current page from the extension menu

Open the extension menu and select the desired engine. This will open a new tab with the results.

### Fetch the archives for a link using the context menu

If your target is a link available in the current page, you can right-click on the link, select "Web Archives" context menu and then select the desired engine.

### Fetch the archive of a given URL from the clipboard

From the extension menu, select the URL Mode and then copy-paste the target URL.

### Change behavior to open new tabs in the background

By default, Web Archives will open the results in a new tab and switch focus to it. If you prefer to open the tab in the background and view the results later, you can adjust this behavior in **Options > Miscellaneous >&#x20;**_**Open new tabs in the background**_.

You can also choose the desired engines and re-order them in the Options.
