## Description

In the absence of GPS EXIF data, its AI system provides GPS estimation. Image EXIF data includes camera model and timestamps.&#x20;

It also offers [georeferencing for aerial imagery](https://picarta.ai/aerial-imagery) captured by aircraft, drones, and satellites. A landmark detection feature is yet to be rolled out.

The API can return up to 100 results with [confidence scores](https://picarta.ai/how-to-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com).&#x20;

The aerial imagery function can be used to for land use monitoring, environmental assessments, and other OSINT research.&#x20;

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

The free plan allows for two searches per day and 25 API Calls. Additional features are available in [paid plans](https://picarta.ai/pricing) to varying degrees.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

Can be used through the [website](https://picarta.ai/how-to-use?), via API, or using an offline model. .&#x20;

## Limitations

The level of accuracy varies widely especially if the photo uploaded lacks distinctive landmarks or features or is of poor quality.&#x20;

While it can help to narrow down on the possible locations, it will still require the user to review and verify the options which can be time-consuming and possibly not provide an accurate assessment.

## Ethical Considerations

The website states that uploaded pictures will be deleted and that it does not collect or store EXIF data, geotags, or any embedded metadata.

## Similar tools

Picarta claims to predict the GPS location of an outdoor image by looking at the top 100 predictions for the input image with a probability of[ 70 percent](https://picarta.ai/how-to-use?).&#x20;

It is useful for determining geolocation compared to Google Reverse Search which can only determine duplicate images or identify similar pictures with people and objects rather than pinpointing a specific location.
