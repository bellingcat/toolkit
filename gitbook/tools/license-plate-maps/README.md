# License Plate Maps

## Description

All countries require registration plates for commercial road vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Requirements for other vehicles, such as bicycles, boats, or tractors vary by jurisdiction. Each country has a different design for their vehicle registration plates, and some designs might look similar.&#x20;

Recognizing the origin country or the purpose of the vehicle by a license plate can sometimes add another data point to research, especially if that research is multi-layered.

Below is a list of websites that provide images and information on license plates around the world. Please note that this list should not be considered exhaustive.&#x20;

No specific requirements.

## Limitations

Keep in mind that all of the above websites are run by license plates enthusiasts and should not be considered comprehensive databases of information or official sources.&#x20;

Those websites may not keep up with changes to local license plate requirements by country, so their information may be out of date. For example, License Plate Mania reported on their website that the latest addition was done on March 10, 2024.&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

While obtaining publicly available data may be lawful, ethical OSINT practitioners are called to consider the broader implications of their work, including the potential impact on individual privacy and the respect for informed consent. This includes being mindful of the balance between research in the public interest and the right to privacy, especially as technology enables more extensive data gathering.

## Use Case Scenarios and Guides

Being able to easily find the country of origin of a license plate will open additional venues of research. Once the license plate is placed as issued by a certain jurisdiction, a researcher may follow these additional steps:

* Find whether the country of origin has a government or a commercial directory for looking up information based on license plates.
* Once such a directory is located, check for fines, traffic infractions, taxes paid or due, partial VIN numbers or even ownership if the jurisdiction allows for such information to be shared with the wider public. One such example is [Mexico](https://www2.repuve.gob.mx:8443/ciudadania/).&#x20;
