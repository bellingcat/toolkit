## Description

QGIS (Quantum GIS) is a free open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software that supports a wide range of functions for managing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data across various platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, and BSD. It is designed to cater to both professionals in the GIS field and enthusiasts who require a robust system for spatial analysis. QGIS supports different data formats and offers tools for vector and raster analysis, map composition, and data editing. The software's flexibility and extendibility through plugins enhance its functionality, enabling users to tackle complex geospatial data analysis and map creation tasks. QGIS is community-driven, relying on contributions from users worldwide to improve and develop new features.

With QGIS you can access various spatial datasets and perform analysis and visualisation. Here the [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) dataset displays state boundaries over Open Street Maps with vector lines highlighting roads:

QGIS can be used by open source researchers for various tasks and projects, for instance to assess environmental and humanitarian issues within conflict zones through spatial analysis.

## Limitations

While QGIS is a powerful tool for geographical information systems, it does have some limitations that researchers should consider:

* **Performance Issues with Large Datasets:** QGIS can become slow when handling very large datasets or complex vector operations. This could impact productivity, particularly on less powerful hardware.
* **Steep Learning Curve:** New users may find the software challenging to learn. While there is extensive documentation and community support, the initial learning phase can be time-consuming.
* **Plugin Reliability:** Not all plugins are equally maintained or documented. Users might encounter stability issues with certain plugins, which can affect project timelines.
* **Limited Advanced Analysis Features:** For highly advanced GIS analysis, some users may find QGIS lacks specific functionalities found in some paid alternatives. For instance, [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) has the Living Atlas of the World a comprehensive collection of high-quality, authoritative maps, and data layers that include demographic, environmental, and geographic information (a comparison between QGIS and ArcGIS is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49QydETVNwg\))).

**Use Cases**

* **Environmental Impact Analysis in Conflict Zones**: Using QGIS to visualize and analyze the reduction of tree cover in areas affected by war, providing insight into environmental degradation. This can be seen in the work by **Godin, P.C., Jake** (2024) on [Gaza’s Trees Disappear, Showing a Humanitarian Crisis](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/03/15/gazas-trees-disappear-showing-a-humanitarian-crisis/), highlighting how GIS data can indicate broader humanitarian issues.
* **Spatial Analysis of Conflict Effects**: Employing count-point-in-polygon calculations with QGIS to quantify the impact of conflict on natural resources, such as the number of conflict events within a specified area affecting forest land. An example is **Giles, C.** (2023) detailing how [A New Tool Shows What War Has Done to Ukraine’s Forests](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/08/18/a-new-tool-shows-what-war-has-done-to-ukraines-forests/), which utilizes spatial data to draw connections between warfare and environmental harm.
