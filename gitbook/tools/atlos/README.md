## Description

The main objective of Atlos is to enable teams of investigators to collaborate easily, even on large-scale investigations. Investigations can be divided into several cases or occurrences which are also called ‘incidents’.

You can, on a single page:

* create and characterise each case;
* alert everyone to the presence of graphic images before researchers get to see it to prevent [vicarious trauma](https://docs.atlos.org/safety-and-security/vicarious-trauma/);
* collect digital material such as photos, videos and pdfs from all over the Internet (press articles, Telegram or X posts,...);
* ... and archive it automatically;

* see material displayed in default greyscale, or colour;
* organise who is assigned to a case or will receive updates on it;
* work on the case simultaneously
* .... and transparently (no comments written on ATLOS can be deleted afterwards, the whole investigation process is recorded);
* specify the GPS coordinates and find the incident on a map;
* analyse the progress of your investigation (How many incidents are waiting to be addressed? To which locations are incidents geolocated?...).

This platform is open source (see [https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos](./#url)), and you can:

* use its web version or [host it yourself](https://docs.atlos.org/technical/self-hosting/);
* [import and export](https://docs.atlos.org/investigations/import-and-export-data/) your data in CSV format;
* create custom integrations, for example with third-party archiving and publishing tools.

## Limitations

If your investigation is small-scale, a spreadsheet may suffice.

If you want to archive a document while working on Atlos, put it in the Source Material category, not in the comments, otherwise only the text and URL are saved.

Your specific use cases may not yet have been encountered by the Atlos team. If you feel the platform is missing an important feature, you can [contact the team via e-mail](https://www.atlos.org/#contact).

Note that the tool providers have clarified [in their FAQ section](https://www.atlos.org/) that 'while Atlos' archival function supports journalistic investigations, it’s not suitable for legal or forensic evidence.'

## Ethical Considerations

Take a look at the Atlos security and risk model which is available [here](https://docs.atlos.org/safety-and-security/risk-model/).&#x20;
