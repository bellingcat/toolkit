## Description

Time.Graphics lets you build timelines directly in your browser. You can add text, images, videos, map locations, and tags. It supports importing events from Google Calendar and exporting timelines as high-resolution images or offline archives.\
Investigators use it to sequence events, compare narratives, and show changes over time. Typical uses include incident chronologies, protest timelines, or case histories.\
Example: assemble posts, press releases, and footage timestamps into a single scrollable timeline, then export a poster-sized image for reports.

## Feature Breakdown

**1. Event Types**

* **Standard Events**: Basic events with customizable names, dates, descriptions, and multimedia options (e.g., images, YouTube videos, documents).
* **Time Periods**: Used to represent spans of time, ideal for tracking project phases or historical periods. Time periods can be open-ended if end dates are uncertain.
* **All Countries Data**: A feature allowing users to add country-specific statistics from the World Bank database, covering various indicators like GDP, population, and more.

**2. Data Visualization and Comparison**

* **Multi-Statistics Tool**: Combines multiple datasets into a single event for easy comparison. For instance, users can plot the GDP or COVID-19 recovery rates of different countries side by side.
* **Geolocation Maps**: Users can add locations to events using map coordinates, suitable for highlighting the geographical context of events.
* **Customizable Graphs and Charts**: Data visualizations can be tailored with colors, line widths, and heights, making it easy to visually differentiate datasets.

**3. Data Import and Export**

* **Google Integration**: Import events directly from Google Calendar, integrate locations with Google Maps, and pull data from Google Sheets.
* **JSON Data Import**: Add real-time data from JSON files hosted on platforms like Pastebin. This enables researchers to access continuously updated information, such as stock prices or live statistics.
* **World Bank Data Access**: Retrieve and plot various economic, health, and social indicators by country, powered by the World Bank's open database.
* **Export Options**: Users can download their timelines in multiple formats for offline viewing or further analysis.

**4. Embedding and Sharing**

* **Embed Timelines on Websites**: Generate HTML code to embed interactive timelines into external websites or articles. This feature is particularly valuable for presenting research findings or timelines to a broader audience.
* **Public and Private Timelines**: Timelines can be set to public, private, or link-access only (premium feature), allowing users to manage who can view and interact with the content.

**5. Collaboration and Team Management**

* **Education Accounts**: Time.Graphics provides educational accounts with options to manage student and teacher access, assign tasks, and oversee collaborative projects within a classroom or group setting.
* **Customizable Permissions**: Users can control access to timelines within teams, allowing only authorized members to edit, view, or comment on shared timelines.

**6. Customization and Styling**

* **Themes and Colors**: Customize timeline elements with various themes and colors to align with specific visual preferences or presentation standards.
* **Tags and Labels**: Add tags to categorize events, making it easier to filter and locate related data on complex timelines.
* **Interactive Elements**: Each timeline event can include interactive elements, such as links to external resources, images, and videos, to enhance the depth and engagement of the timeline.

## Ethical Considerations

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Privacy Controls**: Free timelines default to public; upgrade to premium for full privacy settings and controlled link-based sharing.
{% endhint %}

For effective privacy management on Time.Graphics, users should carefully consider the privacy settings for each timeline, especially when handling sensitive or confidential data. By default, timelines created in the free version are set to public, making them accessible to anyone online. For users requiring privacy or limited access, the **premium version** provides essential options, including the ability to set timelines to private or restrict access to those with a direct link. This link-restricted access is beneficial for sharing information with a controlled audience without making it publicly visible. Users should regularly review and update privacy settings, particularly when working in collaborative settings, to prevent accidental public sharing. For highly sensitive content, it’s advisable to enable premium features that allow complete control over who can view and interact with each timeline, ensuring data is kept secure and accessible only to authorized individuals.

* Avoid publishing sensitive personal data and obtain consent where appropriate.
* Respect copyright and platform terms when attaching media.
* For minors or educational purposes, ensure compliance with local laws and institutional policies.
