## Description

PublicWWW is a specialized search engine that indexes the underlying code and technologies of websites. Unlike traditional search engines, which focus on visible content, PublicWWW scans and catalogs HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and HTTP headers. It currently indexes over 475 million web pages, offering advanced search capabilities including regular expressions, domain filters, and other criteria for highly precise queries. Search results include snippet previews, popularity rankings, and the ability to export data in CSV format for further analysis.

The platform enables users to identify specific code snippets, analytics codes, embedded widgets, themes, and other hidden elements used across the web. It can detect the use of content management systems, JavaScript libraries, tracking codes, and server-side technologies. PublicWWW also provides statistical insights such as file types analysed, generator tags, server headers, and technology adoption trends, allowing for detailed examination of website structures and code usage patterns across a large portion of the internet.
