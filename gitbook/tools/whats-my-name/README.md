# WhatsMyName

## URL

https://whatsmyname.app/

## Description

WhatsMyName Web checks if a particular username exists on different platforms and websites and if it does, it links to it. It is a quick way to find where else a person of interest might have accounts. &#x20;

By searching Bellingcat on WhatsMyName web, we get 37 places where this username is used. The green boxes are clickable and will take you to the user page.&#x20;

By clicking on the "category filter" it is possible to narrow down the results to specifc categories of results, for example "business", "dating", or "shopping".

Beware that different people can use the same username.&#x20;

False positives are also present: you get a result for a platform, but when you click it, it might return "This page does not exist" page or some variation of it.  &#x20;

There are several alternative username tools, including [Sherlock](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/sherlock) and [Blackbird](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/blackbird).&#x20;

## Limitations

You have to allow cookies to use the tool. A CAPTCHA test pops up after clicking the search button. The tool runs searches in 500+ platforms, not "everywhere in the internet". For example, results do not show Facebook and Instagram links. To see all the platforms searched in click "Show All" button.&#x20;

Be aware that the fact that WhatsMyName has found a specific username on various platforms does not necessarily mean that this username belongs to a specific person or organisation.&#x20;
