## Description

This tool allows you to search for seizures, arrests, court cases and convictions related to the environment, wildlife trade and trade in wildlife-related goods worldwide. It contains five versions: #WildEye Global, #WildEye Europe, #WildEye Asia, #WildEye Southern Africa and #WildEye East Africa. You can search in the particular region you are interested in or in all of them. Using a keyword of your choice and search operators if needed, you will get results located on a map, indicating where each event took place. You can view the names, places of arrest/seizure, dates, routes, court case numbers, charges, sentences, among other features of each case. You can also subscribe to receive updates on cases you find interesting and the site will notify you by email about changes.

For example, if you search for the word “donkeys,” you will get all cases worldwide (or by region if you choose to search the other four versions available) involving this species, including cases where donkeys were found along with other species or commodities. This is very useful for cross-investigations.
