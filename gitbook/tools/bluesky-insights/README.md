## Description

Bluesky Insights is a free web-based analytics platform designed specifically for the Bluesky social network. It provides detailed insights into user activity, engagement trends, and content themes without requiring account authentication. Think of it like a “Social Blade” for Bluesky: a third-party website that lets anyone plug in a publicly available Bluesky handle to see at-a-glance metrics and in-depth data visualizations.

## **Features**

**Overview Metrics**

* **Total Posts, Following, Followers**: A quick snapshot of overall activity and reach.
* **Average Likes, Reposts, Replies**: High-level engagement averages to gauge how each post typically performs.
* **Favorite Hashtag & Emoji**: Identifies which hashtag or emoji appears most often in your posts.
* **Most Active Day**: Pinpoints the single day with the highest posting volume.

* Helps reveal dominant themes, topics, or campaigns the user engages with most.

**Posts Activity by Hour**

* Identifying peak posting times can indicate a user’s likely time zone or routine, which can help in creating a bar chart showing posting times across a 24-hour period.
* From an open source research standpoint, identifying peak posting times can indicate a user’s likely time zone or routine, helping to pinpoint when they’re most responsive to events. This allows researchers to focus their monitoring efforts during the most active windows, improving real-time data collection and analysis.

#### **Open Source Research Applications**

* **Profile Monitoring**: Analyze public figures, organizations, or suspicious accounts for posting habits and engagement trends.
* **Disinformation Tracking**: Detect potential “coordinated” engagement patterns or sudden spikes in follower counts.
* **Narrative Analysis**: Examine common themes and keywords across user-generated content.
* **Comparative Analysis**: Compare multiple Bluesky accounts to identify similarities in timing, content, or engagement trends.

By enabling analytics on Bluesky profiles, Bluesky Insights can provide valuable insights for researchers, journalists, and analysts investigating interactions or influence within this decentralized platform.
