latest stable 1.227.9 (August 2025)&#x20;

## Description

Uwazi is an open-source platform designed to manage and organize document collections, often used in human rights documentation and advocacy contexts. It addresses the challenge of storing, categorizing, and retrieving large volumes of sensitive information, and it can be helpful when managing complex datasets.

With Uwazi, researchers can upload documents in bulk, organize them with precise metadata, cross-reference related materials, and search the entire collection efficiently. The platform also allows the translation of records into multiple languages, visualizes data in various formats, and allows collaboration with team members.

Uwazi can be useful for organizations and individuals who need a user-friendly, secure, and customizable tool to manage critical information, whether for preserving evidence, documenting violations, or creating accessible archives. It offers features tailored to the needs of human rights defenders, researchers, and advocacy groups, making it a potentially helpful resource for those working to uncover and pursue justice.

Uwazi offers two deployment options: **self-hosted (free)** and **hosted**. With the [**self-hosted**](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi) option, users can download and set up Uwazi on their own servers at no cost. This option provides full control over the platform, including customization and data security, but it requires technical expertise to install, manage, and maintain the server environment. Self-hosting also implies responsibility for implementing security measures, performing updates, and ensuring system reliability, which might be challenging for organizations without a dedicated IT team.

On the other hand, the **hosted** option involves using Uwazi’s managed hosting service, where the platform is hosted and maintained by [HURIDOCS](https://huridocs.org/). This option is ideal for organizations that prefer a hassle-free setup with support and regular updates handled by the Uwazi team. While hosted services typically involve a cost beyond the initial free 30-day trial, they offer the convenience of professional management, enhanced security, and reliable uptime, making it a suitable choice for organizations with limited technical resources.

8. **Security and Compliance**: Uwazi incorporates security measures, including encrypted data storage and secure access controls, to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and safeguard sensitive information.
9. Integration with the Tella App: Once set up, Uwazi databases can be populated via the [Tella App](https://tella-app.org/), which provides encrypted asynchronous uploads of photos and videos from a user's phone, in an environment separate from the phone's gallery.
10. **Machine-learning add-on (beta)** — [Since April 2025](https://huridocs.org/2025/04/using-machine-learning-in-uwazi-to-support-human-rights-documentation-work/), Uwazi ships with an optional ML module that you can enable from the new **“Machine Learning”** menu. It automatically (a) detects a document’s language and offers instant translation into 20-plus languages, (b) runs [named-entity recognition](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/named-entity-recognition/) to pull out people, organisations, places, dates and other key fields, (c) [segments PDFs into text](https://huridocs.org/2024/08/new-open-source-ai-tool-unlocks-content-and-structure-of-pdfs-effortlessly/), tables and images, generating a ready-made table of contents, and (d) suggests topics and other metadata that users can accept or refine. In partner pilots ([CYRILLA](https://huridocs.org/resource-library/human-rights-research-databases/cyrilla/), [SOS-Defenders](https://huridocs.org/resource-library/human-rights-research-databases/sos-defenders/), [UPR Info](https://huridocs.org/2021/11/by-using-machine-learning-human-rights-organisations-can-better-curate-large-information-collections/)) the tool has cut manual tagging time by up to **90 %** and learns continuously from user feedback. All processing happens in self-hosted setups, or on HURIDOCS infrastructure for hosted clients. The module is still labeled beta and is disabled by default, but the API is already part of the stable 1.219 releas&#x65;**.x** line.

### **Security Measures**

* An independent [security audit conducted by Recurity Labs](https://huridocs.org/2024/08/uwazi-undergoes-third-independent-audit-to-ensure-security/) (commissioned by HURIDOCS) evaluated Uwazi’s architecture and code against common vulnerabilities based on OWASP and SANS standards (which is about as good as it gets). The assessment confirmed that Uwazi maintains a high level of security. Several minor issues were identified, which have since been addressed and patched. A second audit was done by [Assured ](https://www.opentech.fund/security-safety-audits/uwazi-security-audit/)in May 2024. A [third audit](https://huridocs.org/2024/08/uwazi-undergoes-third-independent-audit-to-ensure-security) was concluded in August 2024 to ensure security. Regular Audits are planned.
* Uwazi integrates several technical measures that contribute to a secure environment for handling sensitive human rights documentation and related materials. These features include support for HTTPS encryption, secure user authentication (including two-factor authentication), and the option to run Uwazi behind a reverse proxy for additional network protections. Admins can configure role-based permissions to ensure only authorized users can access or modify sensitive content. Additionally, Uwazi supports regular updates, backups, and indexing maintenance, providing a stable foundation for safeguarding data integrity. Together, these features can make Uwazi a practical choice for organizations that need a reliable, secure digital infrastructure for their human rights work.

#### **Best Practices for Uwazi Administration if running locally**

* **Use Default Configurations First:** Start with Uwazi’s default settings to reduce complexity. Only override environment variables if you have a clear reason and know the impact on your setup.
* **Secure Your Deployment:** Run Uwazi behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx) with HTTPS, and set `LOCALHOST_ONLY=true` so that external traffic must pass through the proxy. When mail notifications are required, properly configure your sendmail or SMTP server.
* **Regular Backups and Data Integrity:** Regularly back up both the MongoDB database and the `uploaded_documents` directory. After restoring, run `yarn migrate` and `yarn reindex` to maintain data integrity and search functionality.
* **Multi-Tenancy and Scaling:** Use distinct database and index names for each tenant, and consider a reverse proxy to direct requests to the correct tenant. Keep code separate from user data, and rely on environment variables to run multiple instances from a single codebase.
* **Routine Maintenance:** Periodically run maintenance scripts like `yarn migrate` and `yarn reindex`. Monitor logs and apply updates or patches as they become available to ensure ongoing stability and security.

For detailed instructions and configurations, refer to the [Sysadmin Guide](https://uwazi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sysadmin-docs/index.html).

## Requirements

To use Uwazi, particularly if you're opting for the self-hosted version, you'll need a server with sufficient resources to handle the platform and a level of technical expertise to manage installation and maintenance. For both hosted and self-hosted options, you need a valid email address to set up accounts and manage user permissions. No additional software is required if using the hosted version, as HURIDOCS handles all management. (Dependencies include Node.js ≥ 20.9, ElasticSearch 8.18.0 (+ optional ICU plugin), MongoDB 6.0 with replica set, Yarn)

## Limitations

* **Technical Setup:**\
  Setting up and customizing Uwazi can require significant technical expertise, especially for self-hosted deployments. While managed hosting options are available, they may involve additional costs.
* **Integration Capabilities:**\
  Uwazi integrates with certain data sources and tools out of the box, including MongoDB and Elasticsearch for storage and indexing, as well as mapping services like Mapbox or [Google Maps](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/google-maps). Its public APIs also support reading and indexing data, and it can accommodate a variety of document formats. However, broad pre-built integrations with external content management systems, analytical platforms, or proprietary tools are limited. Organizations working within complex or diverse technical ecosystems may need to invest in custom development, use Uwazi’s APIs, or rely on manual data exchange methods to achieve seamless integration.
* **Configuration Requirements:**\
  Uwazi’s flexibility demands careful initial configuration, involving the definition of categories, relationships, templates, and filters. For projects with substantial data requirements or intricate structures, this setup can be complex and time-consuming.

## Ethical Considerations

While Uwazi’s security capabilities help protect sensitive information, responsible use remains essential. Human rights documentation often involves vulnerable individuals and communities, so it’s critical to limit data access to trusted team members, maintain strict user permissions, and keep collections private if public release is not appropriate. Ensure robust password practices, enable two-factor authentication, and review audit logs regularly. Consider applicable data protection laws, inform users about the use of cookies, and ensure that any publicly shared data does not expose personal details or put individuals at risk. By taking these ethical considerations into account, Uwazi users can help ensure that their documentation efforts respect privacy, uphold legal standards, and serve the broader goal of advancing human rights.

* **Data Encryption**: Uwazi uses HTTPS encryption for secure data transmission, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. Uwazi also supports data encryption at rest, ensuring that all sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access during transmission and while stored on the server.
* **User Authentication**: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is available to enhance account security.
* **Hosting Security**: Uwazi’s hosted environments are secured with regular updates and security patches.
* **Data Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups must be conducted to ensure data integrity and availability in case of failures.

## Requirements for a Self-Hosted UWAZI Instance

While Uwazi’s managed hosting options range from free to competitively priced, self-hosting can still be appealing—or even necessary—for certain organizations. For example, if strict data protection laws prevent you from using external servers, or you need full control over configurations and integrations, a self-hosted instance provides more autonomy. Some NGOs or advocacy groups may also view self-hosting as a way to reduce ongoing costs, though it’s important to note that the IT overhead and complexity can outweigh initial savings.

**When Does Self-Hosting Make Sense?**

* **Data Sovereignty:** If privacy laws or security policies require complete internal oversight of sensitive information.
* **Customization Needs:** If you want to run custom scripts, integrate with proprietary systems, or manage updates and backups at your own pace.
* **In-House Expertise:** If you have team members with basic server administration experience who can handle ongoing maintenance.

**Technical Requirements and Setup**\
Running a self-hosted Uwazi instance can be done with a modest level of technical expertise, but it’s not entirely plug-and-play. At a minimum, you’ll need:

* **Server Environment:** A modern Linux-based server (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian) with at least 4GB RAM for stable Elasticsearch indexing and MongoDB queries.
* **Core Dependencies:** Node.js, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch correctly installed and configured.
* **Storage and Backups:** Enough disk space for your documents and metadata, plus room for regular backups.
* **Networking and Security:** A stable connection, proper firewall settings, and a reverse proxy (like Nginx) for HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
* **Optional Email Setup:** If you need password resets or notifications, configure sendmail or SMTP.

**Realistic Expectations for Small NGOs**\
If your organization has limited IT resources, self-hosting may still be achievable if you have at least one technically inclined volunteer or staff member. However, without in-house expertise, you might find that managed hosting or hiring external support simplifies setup and reduces long-term hassle. Both approaches are valid—just weigh your need for data sovereignty and flexibility against the time, skills, and budget required to maintain a self-hosted instance.
