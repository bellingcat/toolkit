## Description

Pinpoint is a research tool designed to assist journalists and academics in examining and analyzing large document collections. With Pinpoint, users can upload and search through documents, images, emails, handwritten notes, and transcriptions of audio files to find specific keywords, locations, organizations, or individuals. It is part of the [Journalist Studio](https://journaliststudio.google.com/), Google’s free tool kit for research, data analysis, and data visualization. It also supports metadata extraction, so users can search by fields like date, sender, etc.

Users can store up to [200,000 documents ](https://support.google.com/pinpoint/answer/11955480?hl=en-IN#upload_documents)in each collection, extract text from handwritten documents to make them searchable, query text from images, transcribe audio recordings and search for identifiers in image collections.&#x20;

Its "extract structured data" (in beta) function allows you to convert similarly structured documents into a spreadsheet which can be exported to Excel, Google Sheets or a database.

For example, using Pinpoint, you can search for mentions of keywords like "abuse" or "violence" in [Washington Post's public collection of COVID-19 Nursing Home Inspections](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/search?collection=989c939c11b20432). Named entities inside the documents as persons, organisations and locations are recognised automatically and can be used as filters.&#x20;

## Limitations & Ethical Considerations

Pinpoint has experimental features that use Google's Generative AI solutions, and according to [this notice](https://support.google.com/pinpoint/answer/14338615?hl=en) on Generative AI in Pinpoint, these features "may display inaccurate information, including information about people." Additionally, some of the information you provide may be used to improve functionality, and "Google [human reviewers may read, annotate and process a sample of your Pinpoint data](https://support.google.com/pinpoint/answer/14338615?hl=en), including your prompts and thumbs up or down feedback." As a result, Google cautions against including information "that can be used to identify you, such as phone numbers, email addresses, or birth dates when using Pinpoint’s generative AI features."

Exercise caution and/or check with your parent organization before uploading sensitive or proprietary information, documents and data into Pinpoint.

According to [Pinpoint Additional Terms of Service](https://support.google.com/pinpoint/answer/13071911?hl=en), "if you upload content to Pinpoint, you give Google permission to use that content, including to operate and promote Pinpoint, in accordance with the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) and Google’s Privacy Policy."

Google does [state](https://support.google.com/pinpoint/answer/14338615?hl=en) that the uploaded documents are private by default - unless actively published - and will not be used for training Large Language Models (LLMs).&#x20;

Keep in mind that Pinpoint's generative AI features are currently only available in a [list of countries](https://support.google.com/pinpoint/answer/14338615?hl=en#support_countries).
