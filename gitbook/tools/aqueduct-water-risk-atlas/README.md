## Description

The Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), is a global water risk assessment platform. It facilitates detailed, visual analysis of water stress, drought, flood risk, scarcity, and other modeled water risk indicators using geographic information system (GIS). Researchers, policymakers, and environmentalists widely use it to identify and address water resource challenges.&#x20;

Aqueduct consists of four analytical tools:&#x20;

1. [Water Risk Atlas](https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/water-risk-atlas/#/?advanced=false\&basemap=hydro\&indicator=w_awr_def_tot_cat\&lat=-14.445396942837744\&lng=-142.85354599620152\&mapMode=view\&month=1\&opacity=0.5\&ponderation=DEF\&predefined=false\&projection=absolute\&scenario=optimistic\&scope=baseline\&timeScale=annual\&year=baseline\&zoom=2)
2. [Floods ](https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/floods/)
3. [Country Rankings](https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/country-rankings/)
4. [Food](https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/food/#/)

The Water Risk Atlas and Floods tools will be most widely used by (OSINT) researchers.&#x20;

The interactive Water Risk Atlas projects all data on a zoomable map that can be explored on country, basin or sub-basin levels. Options include:

* View overall water risk, with possibility to adjust indicators and weightings
* View per year or month time period&#x20;
* Select specific water risk indicators (such as Baseline Water Stress, Groundwater decline, Drinking Water access) and prioritize per basin
* Show future models: for 2030, 2050 or 2080 and by optimistic or pessimistic scenarios

Advanced users can upload their own data (csv or xlsx with adresses or coordinates, in beta) or use and build upon the [Aqueduct 4.0 code](https://github.com/wri/Aqueduct40).&#x20;





## Use cases

The Aqueduct water risk atlas can be a useful resource for (open source) researchers who are investigating the following topics:

* Environmental investigations\
  For example: Analyse regions facing acute water stress or shortages.
* Conflict and security\
  For example: overlay population density data with water scarcity layers.
* Policy development\
  For example: Provide recommendations for sustainable water management.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

The Aqueduct tools are webbased so require an internet connection. Some familiarity with GIS or water risk indicators is a plus.

Data can be freely downloaded and shared with attribution to WRI/Aqueduct.&#x20;

## Limitations

There are a few limitations to keep in mind when using the tool:\
Some regions, like remote regions or certain developing countries, might lack data due to limited water monitoring infrastructure.\
The tool includes historical and future projections, but there might not be enough data for real-time analysis.<br>

* Be aware that Aqueduct does not offer raw data, but pre-defined indicators that may not exactly fit your research question. See the info on [Water Risk Indicators](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/help-center/water-risk-indicators) and the [release notes](https://www.wri.org/research/aqueduct-40-updated-decision-relevant-global-water-risk-indicators) for more details on the used methodology.&#x20;
* Projection models are based on climate and socioeconomic scenarios (optimistic, pessimistic and business-as-usual) and may not reflect actual outcomes.&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

Like every tool, ensure that the use of the tool is within the law, the site's terms of services, and ethical OSINT guidelines.

## Guides and articles

The tool is user-friendly and offers tailored help and info within the tool.&#x20;
