## Description

The Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), is a global water risk assessment platform. It facilitates detailed, visual analysis of water stress, drought, flood risk, scarcity, and other modeled water risk indicators using geographic information system (GIS). Researchers, policymakers, and environmentalists widely use it to identify and address water resource challenges.&#x20;

Aqueduct consists of four analytical tools:&#x20;

1. [Water Risk Atlas](https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/water-risk-atlas/#/?advanced=false\&basemap=hydro\&indicator=w_awr_def_tot_cat\&lat=-14.445396942837744\&lng=-142.85354599620152\&mapMode=view\&month=1\&opacity=0.5\&ponderation=DEF\&predefined=false\&projection=absolute\&scenario=optimistic\&scope=baseline\&timeScale=annual\&year=baseline\&zoom=2)
2. [Floods ](https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/floods/)
3. [Country Rankings](https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/country-rankings/)
4. [Food](https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/food/#/)

The Water Risk Atlas and Floods tools will be most widely used by (OSINT) researchers.&#x20;

The interactive Water Risk Atlas projects all data on a zoomable map that can be explored on country, basin or sub-basin levels. Options include:

* View overall water risk, with adjustable indicators and weightings
* View per year or month time period&#x20;
* Select specific water risk indicators (such as Baseline Water Stress, Groundwater decline, Drinking Water access) and prioritize per basin
* Show future models: for 2030, 2050 or 2080 and view by optimistic or pessimistic scenarios

Advanced users can upload their own data (csv or xlsx with adresses or coordinates, in beta) or use and build upon the [Aqueduct 4.0 code](https://github.com/wri/Aqueduct40).&#x20;

The Floods tool shows Hazard, Risk and a Cost-Benefit Analysis. It lets you select on coastal or riverine flood risks. Adjustable parameters include the same timeframes as the Water Risk Atlas, and a choice of Projection Model. The Risk Analyzer can be used to show and compare future flooding risks per country, time period and scenario. A shareable public link can be created per visual, so that it can be included in reports.&#x20;

## Data sources&#x20;

Data comes from international organizations (as the UN), government hydrological and international climate research institutions, and satellite data providers (as NASA, ESA).&#x20;

The raw data is further processed and standardised by the World Resources Institute into global water risk indicators. See the info on [Water Risk Indicators](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/help-center/water-risk-indicators) and the [release notes](https://www.wri.org/research/aqueduct-40-updated-decision-relevant-global-water-risk-indicators) for more details on the used methodology.&#x20;

## Use cases

{% hint style="success" %}
Looking for real time events (live flooding) instead of long term risk analysis? Use [Google Flood Hub](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/google-flood-hub).  &#x20;

Aqueduct can be complemented with [Resource Watch](https://app.gitbook.com/o/WQpOq5ZFue4N6m65QCJq/s/hDFhX74TLSYmA27QoYi7/ "mention") for context and data from other environmental domains.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The Aqueduct water risk atlas can be a useful resource for (open source) researchers who are investigating the following topics:

* Environmental investigations\
  For example: Analyse regions facing acute water stress or shortages.
* Conflict and security\
  For example: overlay population density data with water scarcity layers.
* Policy development\
  For example: Provide recommendations for sustainable water management.

For more inspiration and practical use cases, see the WRI Aqueduct [blog](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/blog) and the [user stories](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/user-stories) (mostly focused on corporate risk).&#x20;

Aqueduct was used in this article '[How data centers are deepening the water crisis](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-data-centers-are-deepening-the-water-crisis-2025-6)' (D. Campbelll, Business Insider).&#x20;

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

* The Aqueduct tools are webbased so require not more than an internet connection. Some familiarity with GIS and water risk indicators is a plus.
* No login is required. WRI supports open data and datasets can be freely downloaded and shared, with attribution to WRI/Aqueduct.&#x20;

## Limitations

* Some regions, like remote regions or certain developing countries, might lack data due to limited water monitoring infrastructure. Zooming in on micro-level is not or not always possible.&#x20;
* Be aware that Aqueduct does not offer raw data, but normalizes to pre-defined indicators that may not exactly fit your research question.&#x20;
* Projection models are based on climate and socioeconomic scenarios (optimistic, pessimistic and business-as-usual) and may not reflect actual outcomes.&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

Like every tool, ensure that the use of the tool is within the law, the site's terms of services, and ethical OSINT guidelines.

## Guides

Aqueduct is user-friendly and offers tailored help and info within the tool. For general info, see the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/faq).&#x20;

There are some [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHC2pCeWNG2tkE0sXzusU17HSHKIiqyzI) specific for the Floods Cost-Benefit Analyzer, a scenario-based tool that estimates potential economic damages from floods.
