Version: Telepathy 2.3.4 (released 2024‑07‑12, as of Oct 25)

## Description

#### Introduction

The toolkit facilitates detailed insights into Telegram channels. It captures information such as the channel's description, total participant count, identifiable members, username, URL, type of chat, chat ID, access hash, the date of the first post, and any restrictions that might be applied. Telegram channels are designed to broadcast messages to a large audience, and they do not allow members to see each other or directly interact within the channel itself.

Telepathy is an open-source OSINT toolkit designed to analyze Telegram communications. It allows users to extract data from public or private Telegram groups and channels and perform searches by user ID or username. Telepathy provides detailed insights such as member lists, group dynamics, and engagement tracking. It also supports CSV export of group members, automatic message translation, and geolocation features for users with public profiles.

### Summary

Telepathy’s user interface is designed to be intuitive for technically experienced users. Its output is tailored for in-depth data analysis. Being open-source, it allows modifications and enhancements to meet specific investigative needs.

Telepathy is CLI‑only. Users should be comfortable installing Python packages, obtaining Telegram API credentials, and running terminal commands. Familiarity with CSV analysis (e.g., in pandas/Excel) and graph tools (e.g., Gephi) is helpful for downstream analysis.

## Requirements

#### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Ensure that Python is installed on your system, as Telepathy is a Python-based tool. You can download Python from the official website.
* **Telegram API Details:** Obtain your Telegram API ID and API Hash by registering an application on [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). These credentials are necessary for Telepathy to interact with the Telegram API.
* For enhanced security, it's recommended to use a separate phone number (a "burner phone") to create a new Telegram account specifically for Telepathy operations. This number is required only during account creation.
* **VPN and Virtual Machines:** To safeguard your privacy and security during investigations, consider using a VPN and running Telepathy within a virtual machine. These measures help protect your main Telegram account and system from potential risks.

## Limitations

* **Telegram API Restrictions:** Telepathy is subject to Telegram's API rate limits and terms of service. Excessive requests or actions that violate these terms can result in temporary or permanent bans, limiting how quickly and extensively you can collect data.
* **Access to Private Groups and Channels:** The tool requires public access or an invitation link to analyze private groups and channels. Without proper access, investigating private communications is not possible.
* **Dependence on User's Telegram Account:** Telepathy operates through your Telegram account. Any limitations or restrictions on your account will impact the tool's functionality. For example, features like user location lookup require your account to have a public profile picture, and some functions may only work if you've previously interacted with the target users or groups.
* **Performance and Scalability Issues:** While installing the `cryptg` library can improve performance, especially for media downloads, Telepathy's efficiency depends on the volume of data and your hardware capabilities. Large-scale investigations may require significant time and resources.
* **Technical Knowledge Requirement:** Setting up and effectively using Telepathy requires technical expertise, including familiarity with command-line interfaces, Python programming, and OSINT techniques. This may present challenges for less technically inclined users.
* **Potential Changes in Telegram API:** Future modifications to the Telegram API or its policies could affect Telepathy's functionality or availability, as the tool relies on this third-party service.
* **Windows Compatibility Issues:** Telepathy may encounter file management and error handling problems on Windows systems, hindering smooth operation and necessitating troubleshooting or updates.
* **Data Analysis Limitations:** While the tool collects extensive data, analyzing and interpreting this information requires significant effort and expertise. Telepathy facilitates data collection but does not provide automatic, in-depth analytical insights; additional tools may be needed for complex analysis.

## Ethical Considerations

* **Legal Compliance: U**se Telepathy following all applicable laws and regulations regarding privacy and data collection. Unauthorized access to private data or misuse of collected information can lead to legal consequences.
* **Responsible Data Handling:** Exercise caution when collecting and storing data, especially media files, to avoid inadvertently downloading illegal or sensitive content. It's essential to manage and secure all collected data responsibly, adhering to legal and ethical standards.
* **Respect for Privacy:** Always respect individuals' privacy rights. Collect data only from sources to which you have the legal right and, if necessary, consent.

## General Advice concerning the security of Telegram

While Telegram offers robust encryption features, it's crucial to remain vigilant about potential security threats, especially when using tools like Telepathy for investigations.

* **Centralized Servers and Data Jurisdiction:** Telegram stores data on centralized servers. Depending on server locations and local laws, authorities may request access to user data. Users outside regions with strong privacy protections (like the GDPR in the EU) should take extra precautions to secure their data.
* **Risks from Compromised Clients:**
  * **Infected Applications:** Malicious or altered versions of the Telegram app can introduce malware or spyware to your device, bypassing encryption by accessing messages directly.
  * **Third-Party Clients:** Unofficial clients not vetted by Telegram may lack proper security measures or be designed to capture user data.
  * **Phishing Attacks:** Be wary of phishing attempts that trick you into downloading compromised software masquerading as legitimate Telegram updates or apps.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
  * **Use Official Clients:** Download Telegram only from the [official website](https://telegram.org/) or recognized app stores to ensure you use a secure version.
  * **Enable End-to-End Encryption:** For sensitive communications, use Telegram's "Secret Chats," which offer end-to-end encryption, ensuring messages are accessible only to intended recipients.
  * **Regular** Updates and Vigilance: Update your Telegram app for the latest security patches. Also, stay alert for any unusual activity or requests that may indicate security issues.
  * Verify Appli**cation Integrity:** Advanced users can verify the reproducibility of the Telegram app build to ensure it matches the published source code, adding an extra layer of security.

By adhering to these practices, you can enhance your security posture while using Telepathy and conducting investigations on Telegram.
