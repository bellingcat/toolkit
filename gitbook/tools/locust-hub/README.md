## Description

A public portal managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The portal offers a geographic and time sensitive visualization of both hopper groups and swarms. The data is concatenated [from reports to the FAO from affected countries](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2020/06/23/how-to-track-desert-locust-swarms/).

Green dots represent the presence of hopper groups, which are immature desert locusts that have not yet developed wings, and are much easier for pesticides to eliminate. Red dots represent adult swarms — far more destructive locust groups that can fly and travel longer distances.

LocustHub can help to analyse locust movement. It also provides a weekly tracker on the number of swarms, hoppers, locust control operations, as well as how the number changes weekly.

The data can be used to predict movement of swarms, when used in conjunction with tools such as  [windfinder.com](https://www.windfinder.com/) which offers a map of wind speeds in the region, or [soil moisture viewer](https://locust-hub-hqfao.hub.arcgis.com/pages/lobelia-viewer), as locusts thrive after heavy periods of rainfall.

In an effort to scale up data collection, the [FAO is calling](https://twitter.com/FAOLocust/status/1258032596224749568) for people in affected regions to report locust sightings through an app, [eLocust3m](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elocust3m/id1510684948?ls=1), which is available on both Android and IOS.

In eLocust3m, users enable location tracking in order to submit a report, which includes relevant details on the locust swarm and photo evidence. All frontline countries affected by desert locusts have a National Locust Control Centre, where the reports are initially received.

Data from each country is then collated into a single file and sent daily to FAO Headquarters in Rome, where the reports are validated. The FAO also trains groups of local users to maintain consistent updates on locust presence.

## Level of difficulty

## Requirements

Users can create an account to create a custom dashboard and save results.

## Limitations

The hub is mostly descriptive (i.e., past and current sightings). The data quality will vary per country as it depends on inputs by local teams.&#x20;

Some familiarity with ArcGIS tools will be required for non-specialists.&#x20;

Although the data is regularly updated, it may not always be updated in time for highly time-sensitive decision making or making real-time predictions.

## Ethical Considerations

It is advisable to avoid mixing Locust Hub data with personally identifiable or politically sensitive datasets to avoid identification of communities or individuals.

## Guides and articles
