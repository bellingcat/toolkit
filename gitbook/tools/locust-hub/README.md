## Description

A public portal managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The portal offers a geographic and time sensitive visualization of both locust hopper groups and swarms. The data is concatenated [from reports to the FAO from affected countries](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2020/06/23/how-to-track-desert-locust-swarms/).

Green dots represent the presence of hopper groups, which are immature desert locusts that have not yet developed wings, and are much easier for pesticides to eliminate. Red dots represent adult swarms — far more destructive locust groups that can fly and travel longer distances.

LocustHub can help to analyse locust movement. It also provides a [weekly tracker](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d8df827fc77340b29740e7b151de1674) on the number of swarms, hoppers, locust control operations, as well as how the number changes weekly.

The data can be used to predict movement of swarms, when used in conjunction with tools such as  [windfinder.com](https://www.windfinder.com/) which offers a map of wind speeds in the region, or [soil moisture viewer](https://locust-hub-hqfao.hub.arcgis.com/pages/lobelia-viewer), as locusts thrive after heavy periods of rainfall.

In an effort to scale up data collection, the [FAO is calling](https://twitter.com/FAOLocust/status/1258032596224749568) for people in affected regions to report locust sightings through an app, [eLocust3m](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elocust3m/id1510684948?ls=1), which is available on both Android and IOS.

In eLocust3m, users enable location tracking in order to submit a report, which includes relevant details on the locust swarm and photo evidence. All frontline countries affected by desert locusts have a National Locust Control Centre, where the reports are initially received.

Data from each country is then collated into a single file and sent daily to FAO Headquarters in Rome, where the reports are validated. The FAO also trains groups of local users to maintain consistent updates on locust presence.

## Requirements

Users can create an account to create a custom dashboard and save results.

## Limitations

The hub is mostly descriptive (i.e., past and current sightings). The data quality will vary per country as it depends on inputs by local teams.&#x20;

Some familiarity with GIS tools will be required for non-specialists.&#x20;

Although the data is regularly updated, it may not always be updated in time for research on the real-time status or for making predictions.

## Ethical Considerations

If using Locust Hub data with personally identifiable or politically sensitive datasets it is advisable to avoid unintentionally exposing individuals or communities to risk.&#x20;

Data should be contextualized, anonymized where necessary, and presented with transparency about its limitations and sources.

## Guides and articles

## Tool provider

Managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations headquartered in Rome, Italy.

## Similar tools

Tools similar to Locust Hub:

[eLocust3m](https://apps.apple.com/th/app/fao-elocust3m/id1673483386): This is a smartphone app developed by FAO in collaboration with PlantVillage / Penn State, designed for field teams and even community observers to report locusts.

[eLocust3](https://www.fao.org/locust-watch/activities/dlis-home): This includes a field survey device with tablet and satellite antenna used by national survey/control teams, especially in remote areas where connectivity is poor. It includes features like mapping, navigation, recording of infestation polygons (via GPS) and data transmission via satellite so that even remote survey teams can send data.

[EarthRanger](https://www.earthranger.com/success-stories/fao): Developed for wildlife management, EarthRanger has been enhanced to ensure ingestion of eLocust3m and eLocust3g data as well as exporting manually entered data in a compatible format for inclusion in the RAMSES GIS used by national locust authorities. It is used to manage survey and control aircraft / assets, track spray operations, visualize maps of where swarms and control interventions are happening.

For predictive modelling, Locust Hub is best used in conjunction with other tools such as:
