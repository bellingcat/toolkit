## Description

A public portal managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The portal offers a geographic and time sensitive visualization of both desert locust hopper groups and swarms. The data is updated frequently with the latest observations from the field including [from reports to the FAO from affected countries](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2020/06/23/how-to-track-desert-locust-swarms/).

Green dots represent the presence of groups of hoppers or young locusts that cannot fly but are a threat to ground-level crops, while yellow dots represent groups of adult, winged locusts. Blue dots represent bands or larger groups of hoppers which tend to be easier to eliminate than swarms. Red dots represent adult swarms, which are the most damaging group as they can fly long distances and wipe out entire fields within hours.

LocustHub can help to analyse locust movement. It provides a [weekly tracker](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d8df827fc77340b29740e7b151de1674) on the number of swarms, hoppers, locust control operations, as well as how the number changes every month and every three months. Data is updated every four hours.&#x20;

The data can be used to predict movement of swarms, when used in conjunction with tools such as  [windfinder.com](https://www.windfinder.com/) which offers a map of wind speeds in the region, or [soil moisture viewer](https://locust-hub-hqfao.hub.arcgis.com/pages/lobelia-viewer), as locusts thrive after heavy periods of rainfall.

## Requirements

Users will need to create an account through this [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeagLDm9KkPYVe2fiJ7mmU0Zs6f98lIBAXRGqgrjMEPhOPxAg/viewform) and create a [FAO Data in Emergency Community ](https://hqfao.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/oauth2/signup?oauth_state=ag8BfOHP4NbKhIToav6RUSQ..q9CeqT6GCT0imEsisBKnMyLVmTGYfuLyuYZmbENjAHBMLovUvi2_OWGPRABHAYoX2S5z30r508VMWI0l24Y40WCx45QNS99pqbIHLbD09XVEIKrngTOZFuMK-Dv1SbYzkGQwWf3TNB-yIIPrXPkBzVC1fPfTjtrGJJyIjHLjfbFxd3vpF6MAoBhNVFeLKr_0WGzcWEcjRSX1rYJlit19McM79mmF5RWYeOayhW-hbCeGacufop8fICiadjCiQU13bbWNLLMSgG-EQ89Fbk6LkPJem4du0Irk9jSYdcDPZDSTaFOjcaRB0fmFXGl_Rgrytnv70ZnJOOZPKfoxXHoHX3Au3mMxBZtLCpaYzjKgKFfBn29RFZRDMq89R5YW2IVpDa1nUvCAF9wKbv-cBpqkfm9i0fUFXYAqQZ0.)account to have access to the full historical archives dataset of Desert Locust. The data provided are "archival" data, from 1965 to last year.&#x20;

Real-time data are not available but can be seen through the [Locust-Hub data explorer.](https://locust-hub-hqfao.hub.arcgis.com/)

Users can also use an ArcGIS login if provided by their institution.

## Limitations

The hub is mostly descriptive (i.e., past and current sightings). The data quality will vary per country as it depends on inputs by local teams.&#x20;

Some familiarity with GIS tools will be required for non-specialists.&#x20;

Although the data is regularly updated, it may not always be updated in time for research on the real-time status or for making predictions.

## Ethical Considerations

If using Locust Hub data with personally identifiable or politically sensitive datasets, it is advisable to avoid unintentionally exposing individuals or communities to risk. Data should be contextualized, anonymized where necessary, and presented with transparency about its limitations and sources.

## Tool provider

Managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations headquartered in Rome, Italy.

## Similar tools

Tools similar to Locust Hub:

[eLocust3m](https://apps.apple.com/th/app/fao-elocust3m/id1673483386): This is a smartphone app developed by FAO in collaboration with PlantVillage / Pennâ€¯State, designed for field teams and even community observers to report locusts.

[eLocust3](https://www.fao.org/locust-watch/activities/dlis-home): This includes a field survey device with tablet and satellite antenna used by national survey/control teams, especially in remote areas where connectivity is poor. It includes features like mapping, navigation, recording of infestation polygons (via GPS) and data transmission via satellite so that even remote survey teams can send data.

[EarthRanger](https://www.earthranger.com/success-stories/fao): Developed for wildlife management, EarthRanger has been enhanced to ensure ingestion of eLocust3m and eLocust3g data as well as exporting manually entered data in a compatible format for inclusion in the RAMSES GIS used by national locust authorities. It is used to manage survey and control aircraft / assets, track spray operations, visualize maps of where swarms and control interventions are happening.

For predictive modelling, Locust Hub is best used in conjunction with other tools such as:
