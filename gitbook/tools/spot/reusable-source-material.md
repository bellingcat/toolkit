<summary>Spot works in 4 stages, from natural language input to streetview comparison of outputs. <em>Click for more on the 4 stages...</em></summary>

1. Spot takes natural language prompts as input from the user, i.e. sentences written in everyday language, and converts these sentences into query language  code with a formal structure (which isdisplayed to the user in a separate box in the interface) called [Overpass Query Language](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL).
2. Spot  uses the query  language code to perform a search of OpenStreetMap (by building an Overpass query).
3. Spot displays all the features which satisfy the user's input search on a map. It does not sort features which relate to different candidate location solutions, so if there is more than one potential solution,&#x20;

1) For each feature marked on the output map, Spot offers the user the option to open a [street view](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] window within the tool, using data from a choice of three of the largest providers of street view photography (Google, Yandex, and Bing).

\[Need Venn diagram or a hierarchy demonstrating tool to show the issues of categorization, e.g. we want all military bases. If the system has categorized police buildings separately, we will need to search for those separately: they will not be returned within a military bases search. If the system has a hierarchy within which police buildings are a subset of military bases, then police buildings will be returned in a military bases search. This is an important point about categorisations. It is a generic issue, not specific to Spot]
