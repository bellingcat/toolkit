Here, you can edit the OSM tags assigned to each feature. OSM tags define features of map [elements](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/about) which “add meaning to geographic objects.”&#x20;

According to the TagInfo site for OSM tags, “there is no fixed list of those tags. New tags can be invented and used as needed. Everybody can come up with a new tag and add it to new or existing objects.”

A tag is made of two [items](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags): a key and a value. A key describes the category or type of feature. A [value](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags#Keys_and_values) “provides detail for the key-specified feature." For example, an OSM key, “waterway”, can have multiple values that define this key. Some of them include a stream, ditch, river, drain, canal, and dam, among others. These can be adjusted depending on the needs of the search.

This feature is similar to [Bellingcat’s OpenStreetMap](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/openstreetmap-search-tool) search tool, which uses a custom setting for adding features, enabling adjustments via the OSM key and value.
