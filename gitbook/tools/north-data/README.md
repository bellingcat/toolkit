## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

User registration is required for accessing certain features (see cost section).

## Limitations

* Interactive graph starts with first-degree relations (company ↔︎ persons/companies). You can click nodes to reveal second-degree links, but bulk export/API still returns first-degree only.
* Our own tests showed that some financial data or indicators are limited under a free account, are inconsistently updated or unavailable.
* The data is only limited to 24 countries, the full list of sources with update frequency can be found [here](https://www.northdata.com/_coverage#sources).
* Network graph initially shows first-degree relations; you can click nodes to reveal deeper levels, but **CSV / API export is still limited to one hop**.

## Ethical Considerations

* Individuals with common names or aliases can be misidentified without using additional information about the target, leading to false allegations.
* Data contains sensitive information such as addresses or contact information.
* It can reveal personal relationships that aren’t widely known. (For example, birthdays, passport information, addresses, etc., depending on the company-related documents retained by governmental bodies.)
