## Description

A tool to identify satellites which can provide usable imagery for a given area of interest, either historically or in the future. Some imagery is free, higher resolution imagery can be bought from certain providers direct from the site.&#x20;

The interface can take a drawn area of interest on a map, or location co-ordinates.

> For Sentinels the acquisition plans usually have a range of 10-15 days, while for Landsats it’s 2-4 days. The time range that you can view is limited to 24 hours due to a large number of polygons. You can also access this data as GeoJSON from our[ API](https://api.spectator.earth/).

> **Data source**

The files are retrieved from ESA and USGS websites. Links to raw data:[ Sentinel-1](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/copernicus/sentinel-1/acquisition-plans),[ Sentinel-2](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/copernicus/sentinel-2/acquisition-plans),[ Landsat](https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat_acq)

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

Free historical satellite imagery is offered from lower resolution services like Sentinel and Landsat. Paid historical and tasked imagery is sold from the Pleiades service.
