## Description

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/SOAR57secs VERSION2 ezgif-2389f6798f6c69.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>SEARCHING FOR MAPS FOR A GIVEN LOCATION, VIEWING OVERLAY ON OPENSTREETMAP AND SATELLITE DATA USING GEOREFERENCED TRANSPARENCY FEATURE, SELECTING APPROPRIATE SATELLITES PASSING OVERHEAD</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
The Tajikistan National Mosaic map was chosen from the database because it was made many decades ago by the Soviet military (as part of a much larger project) before the break up of the Soviet Union. The skill and survey manpower which were employed in its creation mean that it contains some of the most valuable information which is available today on such remote regions. Soar provides a wealth of maps made in the past, which is a useful reminder of their value, as well as an important resource for Open Source researchers.
{% endhint %}

Soar is described as a Digital Atlas containing over a million maps. Its main functions are:

* **Map Database access**

Provision of [read and write access](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] to a large and growing searchable database of maps from all geographies, indexed in many dimensions, such as resolution, georeference status,  topical interest category[^2]. These include maps animated to show change over time and drone imagery, as well as satellite imagery.

* **Selection and acquisition of Satellite Imagery**

Selection and acquisition of satellite imagery from a range of providers, both free and purchased. Available satellite paths can be displayed and filtered over any map of interest, so that users can direct their search for relevant satellite imagery to the appropriate satellite service, date and time.

* **Narrative Creation and Data Sharing**

Provision of online visualisation features allowing the creation of multi-image narratives, and the facility to upload and share user imagery, including narrative formats.

These constitute some of the major tasks which Open Source researchers undertake during investigations, making Soar **a multi-purpose platform for OSINV**.

{% hint style="success" %}
Note that some satellite imagery maps in the Soar database are of very high quality, i.e. 8cm per pixel resolution, making them particularly valuable resources.
{% endhint %}

### The Soar Interface

{% hint style="info" %}
The Discover and Maps sections of the Soar interface are in fact just different routes to the same information - the maps database. Discover is centred around searching information by category, whilst Maps is centred around searching for information by location.
{% endhint %}

{% columns %}
{% column %}
**SOAR DATA SOURCES**

Data sources for Soar's million maps include:&#x20;

1\. **Individuals** (example https://soar.earth/profile/Warmapper and https://soar.earth/profile/spacefromspace)

**2. Organizations** (https://soar.earth/profile/UN or https://soar.earth/profile/EU)

**3. Government agency** (https://soar.earth/profile/USGS)&#x20;

**4. Other satellite image providers** (https://soar.earth/profile/Umbra)&#x20;
{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
**SOAR MAP INFORMATION TYPES**

The database includes:

* a wide variety of geographically distributed information,e.g. weather, maritime tides, distribution of dust and ash, soil moisture, population, radar, ...&#x20;
* different time modalities, e.g. static maps created over a long time period stretching back at the time of writing (Oct 25) to at least 1572, maps displaying real-time information feeds, animated gif maps displaying a sequence of changing information over time.
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

Soar maps are searchable by features including location, map category, indexing tags, uploading username, georeference[^3] status,...

### **Navigating the Interface to the Soar Map Database**

The Soar interface has been regularly updated and redesigned since its launch.&#x20;

#### **At Database Level**

**T**he Soar interface provides lists of maps relating to a given location, ways to filter them, a selection of base world map views, and a filterable selection of satellite paths.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/ANNOTATEDEXPLODED.JPG" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>THE SOAR INTERFACE WHEN SEARCHING FOR MAPS</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

When working from a location, users can:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Define

Enter a name or co-ordinates, Zoom to a region and select an exact bounding box location with the box zoom function.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### View

View and filter the maps presented by Soar around this specific location
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select

Select a map and, if available, change Transparency to inspect the overlay of the georeferenced map against the base map, comparing features
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Compare

Change the base map to inspect against OpenStreetMap, OpenElevation, Satellite and Hybrid views
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Find Satellite Imagery

Open and filter satellite paths to establish which could provide imagery of the region

Invoke SATELLITE mode to find historic imagery or to commission immediate satellite imagery of the specifc location (both free and paid offered)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Create and Share A Narrative

Invoke STOARY mode to create narrative content

Invoke UPLOAD mode to add content to the Soar database
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### **At Map Level**

**T**he Soar interface offers data on the account which posted the map, the facility to read and post comments, the set of tags describing the map, and the ability to adjust the map transparency against the base map underlay, and a tool to create graphic narratives.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Interface MAP annotated2.JPG" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>THE SOAR INTERFACE WHEN VIEWING A SELECTED MAP FROM THE DATABASE</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that Soar categorises maps as either Georeferences or LoFi as per the definitions below:
{% endhint %}

{% columns %}
{% column %}
**LOFI MAPS - NOT GEOREFERENCED**

Can't be linked to real-world co-ordinates

These are image files which can't be layered on top of standard geographic basemaps like OSM, due to the lack of necessary data to position them on a map accurately. Users may still zoom in and pan around using Soar, but it's best to treat them as standalone images that can't be integrated with geographic layers.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/https___files.gitbook.com_v0_b_gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com_o_spaces_2F2U83UEO8KjkX3jGLBsBn_2Fuploads_2FdcI1dFHcn1wkuH9HV5iT_2F2025-09-03_21-39-44 (1).avif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
**GEOREFERENCED MAPS**

Has been linked to real-world co-ordinates

These are maps or images (whether satellite, aerial, or drone capture) which contain specific Earth coordinates and allow for precise geographic positioning. This coordinate-linking allows for layering additional map data on top or making transparency adjustments.&#x20;



<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/https___files.gitbook.com_v0_b_gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com_o_spaces_2F2U83UEO8KjkX3jGLBsBn_2Fuploads_2FWvCTgEs5h8kkyymksYR5_2Flofi (1).avif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The transparency slider is not available for LoFi maps.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

<mark style="color:$danger;">**\[We thought we might illustrate a stoary**</mark>**&#x20;**<mark style="color:$info;">**(I think maybe we tested the GIF feature for Evergreen instead of a Stoary?)**</mark>**&#x20;**<mark style="color:$danger;">**with the Evergreen Ship incident,stuck in the Suez canal 23-29/3/21**</mark>

GREAT SO&#x20;

* WE CAN USE THE EVERGREEN ANIMATED GIF EXAMPLE FOR GIF FEATURE
* WE CAN USE TAJIKISTAN FOR THE STOARY FEATURE(Tajikistan inscriptions visible from satellite.]



3. The facility to upload and share user maps (Formats are Georeferenced maps=GeoTIFF, ECW and JP2, LoFi Map formats = PNG and JPEG and create geographical media (called Stoaries <mark style="color:$danger;">**need to check the exact definition of a Stoary - is it a set of digital pages which can include gif animation? Stoaries - you can annotate a map (TEST maybe only an OSB background map, not a Soar upload**</mark>**&#x20;**<mark style="color:$info;">**(Tested and it looks like you can annotate a Soar upload (see my attempt at explaining the step below)**</mark><mark style="color:$danger;">**) and it will allow you to add the coordinates of a map pin in any chosen metric system. You can add photos or video to locations**</mark> to communicate complex information, e.g. changes over time.

### <mark style="color:$primary;">Maybe a Hint? Definitely a limitation!</mark>

{% hint style="danger" %}
There are quite a few elements which don't actually export to GeoJSON format from Soar

{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:$primary;">Is there a separate item about making animated GIFS? Is that just Satellite site functionality, passed through?</mark>

### <mark style="color:$info;">"Stoary": What is it?</mark>

_<mark style="color:$info;">(Post on X:</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:$info;">https://x.com/Soar\_Earth/status/1825483446816223415</mark>_](https://x.com/Soar_Earth/status/1825483446816223415)_<mark style="color:$info;">, but I believe this is similar to "ESRI StoryMaps")</mark>_\ <mark style="color:$info;">Based on our tests, a Stoary seems to be a visualization feature of the Soar platform that allows storytelling based on maps or imagery. Rather than using static imagery or a map screenshot, users can use</mark> <mark style="color:$info;"></mark><mark style="color:$info;">**pages**</mark> <mark style="color:$info;"></mark><mark style="color:$info;">of maps/imagery to add context, descriptions, icons, and additional multimedia. This helps walk readers through a story arc tied to a place or several places.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:$info;">It allows creators to combine text, imagery, user-uploaded maps, and geospatial layers.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:$info;">Each page of a "Stoary" is scene-based. The user can choose a location/view and add context.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:$info;">Soar's step-by-step guide to creating a Stoary is found</mark> [<mark style="color:$info;">here</mark>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G97wi-zaTfM)<mark style="color:$info;">.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:$info;">**Stoary Features:**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:$info;">Pages of maps/imagery — This feature is helpful if, for instance, users are following one event in different locations (i.e., St. Patrick’s Day Parades worldwide. One can track it in cities like Dublin, Boston, and New York, and visualize that.</mark> &#x20;
   1. <mark style="color:$info;">Each page of a Stoary can use a basemap (OSM, Satellite, etc) provided</mark>
   2.  <mark style="color:$info;">Can use user-uploaded Soar maps! (screenshot below)</mark>

       <mark style="color:$info;">NOTE: If using a Soar uploaded map for your Stoary, the transparency feature can be used. YES!!</mark>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-11 095007.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. <mark style="color:$info;">Annotation (especially the coordinates feature)</mark>

<mark style="color:$danger;">\[Insert screenshot graphic of the location co-ordinates feature for annotating maps in Stoary section.]</mark>

3. <mark style="color:$info;">Photo Overlay - overlay photos from news or stock sites (with attribution), or social media, which can be good for corroboration.</mark>
4. <mark style="color:$info;">Sharing and Exporting</mark>&#x20;

To demonstrate the visualization capability of a "Stoary", we used the feature below using information [from a 2024 investigation by Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/12/18/ukraine-outraged-at-yemen-grain-shipment-from-occupied-crimea/). NOTE: This is for demonstration purposes only.&#x20;

* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

\[\[Pricing or subscription information, if relevant.]]

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>



Difficulty Level and Learning Curve:

Overall: For a casual user exploring maps, the difficulty is moderate <mark style="color:$info;">(?)</mark>. For an investigator requiring precise data or intending to contribute advanced imagery, the difficulty is high <mark style="color:$info;">(?)</mark>, requiring some understanding of geospatial data principles or reliance on integrated GIS tools.



## Requirements

<mark style="color:$info;">Account sign up / Email Address</mark>

<mark style="color:$info;">Modern browser - There are definitely moments where loading maps and zooming in for details can cause the browser to freeze.</mark>&#x20;



## Limitations

<mark style="color:$danger;">**Do we move some of the content above from the Level of Difficulty section?**</mark>**&#x20;**<mark style="color:$info;">**Yes, I have moved some**</mark>

* <mark style="color:$info;">Some maps are georeferenced, some are not (usually old ones)</mark>
* <mark style="color:$info;">Some Satellite images that are high quality - can take long to load when zooming in and out (i.e.</mark> [<mark style="color:$info;">https://soar.earth/maps/world-cloud-properties-western-hemisphere-last-10-minutes-132716?pos=-26.623553540465934%2C-23.02786284286767%2C3.69</mark>](https://soar.earth/maps/world-cloud-properties-western-hemisphere-last-10-minutes-132716?pos=-26.623553540465934%2C-23.02786284286767%2C3.69)<mark style="color:$info;">)</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:$info;">Confusing user interface</mark>
*   <mark style="color:$info;">Stoaries are very difficult to edit. Going to the "page" of the map you want to edit does not take you to that location. Instead, you have to re-input the location or coordinates in the search bar.</mark> &#x20;

    <mark style="color:$info;">Use a browser that does not go into "efficiency mode," as this can freeze the Soar and the Stoary interface consistently.</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:$info;">Intermediate to Advanced Use: The difficulty level increases for more advanced functionalities. Some of them are:</mark>

&#x20;  <mark style="color:$info;">- Uploading and Georeferencing: While the process is streamlined,</mark> [<mark style="color:$info;">users uploading their own maps or imagery need to ensure proper georeferencing and rectification. The platform has strict guidelines for alignment, which may require some prior knowledge or learning on the user's part,</mark>](https://about.soar.earth/help) <mark style="color:$info;">especially if their original data lacks precise georeferencing.</mark> [<mark style="color:$info;">The QGIS plugin helps with this process,</mark> ](https://north-road.com/2023/08/24/soar-earth-digital-atlas-qgis-plugin/)<mark style="color:$info;">however this may be limited to for GIS-savvy users and may mean a higher barrier for those without GIS software experience.</mark>&#x20;





## Ethical Considerations

A. Data Verification and Accuracy:

* Cross-reference Soar.earth imagery with other sources (e.g., commercial satellite providers, ground reports) to ensure accuracy
* Understand the limitations of satellite imagery (e.g., cloud cover, revisit times, resolution).
* Source: [Help - Soar (on real-time imagery limitations)](https://about.soar.earth/help)

B. Privacy / Consent:

* Be mindful of privacy implications when analyzing high-resolution imagery, particularly concerning private property or individuals.
* Adhere to ethical guidelines regarding data collection and dissemination.

C. Misinformation and Disinformation:

* Be aware that user-generated content, while valuable, may not always be authoritative. Always verify the source and context of shared maps/imagery.
