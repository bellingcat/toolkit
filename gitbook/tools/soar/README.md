## Description

The Soar platform provides a number of services: <mark style="color:$danger;">**QUESTION: What is the difference bewteen the features "Maps" and "Discover"?**</mark>&#x20;

1. A large database of maps and imagery displaying&#x20;

* a wide variety of geographically distributed information,e.g. weather, maritime tides, distribution of dust and ash, soil moisture...&#x20;
* with different time modalities, e.g. static maps created over a long time period stretching back to  <mark style="color:$danger;">**1800 (looking for read date of oldest),**</mark> maps displaying real time information feeds,&#x20;

These Soar entires are serachable by :<mark style="color:$danger;">**Need to test what other search keys can be used - there are filters in Discover section for 2 Map Types: LoFi and Georeferenced, which we should probably define (I can't right now) and then about 15 categorisations:**</mark>

One of Soar's most immediately valuable features is the ability to overlay imagery and maps in layers and the adjust transparency. <mark style="color:$danger;">**Need to test can we adjust the relative scale of the maps to get them to fit over one another in the same location??**</mark>

<mark style="color:$danger;">**NB Note that Soar puts labels over Thumbnail maps to give information as to format, but these formats don't correspond exactly to the filters offered by Soar - labels include "GIF", "REAL TIME", "DAILY", POPULAR", "NEW", "LoFi (which IS one of the filterable categories)**</mark>

2. An interface
3. The facility to create maps (called Stoaries <mark style="color:$danger;">**need to check the exact definition of a Stoary - is it a set of digital pages which can include gif animation?**</mark>) to communicate complex information, e.g. changes over time

<mark style="color:$danger;">**NB There are quite a few things which don't actually export to GeoJSON format when you export**</mark>
