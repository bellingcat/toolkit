## Description

The Soar platform provides a number of services:

A large database of maps and imagery displaying a wide variety of geographical information,e.g. weather, maritime tides, distribution of dust and ash, soil moisture... created over a long time period stretching back to  serachable by location <mark style="color:$danger;">**Need to test what other search keys can be used - there are filters in Discover section for 2 Map Types: LoFi and Georeferenced, which we should probably define (I can't right now) and then about 15 categorisations:**</mark>&#x20;

One of Soar's most immediately valuable features is the ability to overlay imagery and maps in layers and the adjust



The facility to create maps (called Stoaries <mark style="color:$danger;">**need to check the exact definition of a Stoary - is it a set of digital pages which can include gif animation?**</mark>) to communicate complex information, e.g. changes over time

<mark style="color:$danger;">**NB There are quite a few things which don't actually export to GeoJSON format when you export**</mark>
