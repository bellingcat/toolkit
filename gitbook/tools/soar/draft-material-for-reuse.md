## Soar

Soar is a platform sharing a growing database of over a million entries (maps, satellite, aerial & radar imagery), access to imagery from statellite providers, and tools to create geographic narratives

Soar is a database of over a million diverse maps & images , on a platform where users can explore, upload, share and interact with a vast collection of content (including satellite, aerial & radar).

## Description

Soar is described as a Digital Atlas containing over a million maps. Its main functions are:

* **Map Database access**

Provision of [read and write access](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] to a large and growing searchable database of maps from all geographies, indexed in many dimensions, such as resolution, georeference status,  topical interest category. These include maps animated to show change over time and drone imagery, as well as satellite imagery.

* **Selection and acquisition of Satellite Imagery**

Selection and acquisition of satellite imagery from a range of providers, both free and purchased. Available satellite paths can be displayed and filtered over any map of interest, so that users can direct their search for relevant satellite imagery to the appropriate satellite service, date and time.

* **Narrative Creation**

Provision of online visualisation features allowing the creation of multi-image narratives.&#x20;

These functions constitute some of the major tasks which Open Source researchers undertake during investigations, making Soar **a multi-purpose platform for OSINV.**

Note that some satellite imagery maps in the Soar database are of very high quality, i.e. 8cm per pixel resolution, making them particularly valuable resources when they cover a researcher's region of interest.

### The Soar Interface

{% hint style="info" %}
The Discover and Maps sections of the Soar interface are in fact just different routes to the same information - the maps database. Discover is centred around searching information by category, whilst Maps is centred around searching for information by location.

#### Navigating the Interface to the Soar Map Database

When working from a location, users can:

* Enter a name or co-ordinates, Zoom to a region and select an exact bounding box location.
* View and filter the maps presented by Soar around this specific location
* Select a map and, if available, change Transparency to inspect the overlay of the georeferenced map against the base map, comparing features
* Change the base map to inspect against OpenStreetMap, OpenElevation, Satellite and Hybrid views
* Open and filter satellite paths to establish which could provide imagery of the region
* Invoke SATELLITE mode to find historic imagery or to commission immediate satellite imagery of the specifc location (both free and paid offered)
* Invoke STOARY mode to create narrative content
* Invoke UPLOAD mode to add content to the Soar database

[^1]: Soar allows users to view maps in the database, and also make their own annotated copies of those maps. Users can upload their own maps to be added to the database
