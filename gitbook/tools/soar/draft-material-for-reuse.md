## Description

\[Insert graphic of gif showing overlay of candidate Soar map over OSM background and increasing transparency to show perfect fit of Georeferenced map]

Soar is described as a Digital Atlas containing over a million maps. Its main functions are:

* A growing searchable database of maps from all geographies, indexed in many dimensions, such as resolution, georeference status, &#x20;

<mark style="color:$info;">Soar is primarily a comprehensive digital atlas where users can discover, explore, navigate, and upload diverse maps and imagery. But it also functions as both a GIS exploration/navigation tool and a social platform for the global cartography community. The platform also enables satellite acquisition, user uploads, and visualization through its "Stoary" and GIFs feature for creating multi-slide map narratives with community-driven content sharing.</mark>
