Soar is described as a Digital Atlas containing over a million maps. Its main functions are:

* **Map Database access**

Provision of [read and write access](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] to a large and growing searchable database of maps from all geographies, indexed in many dimensions, such as resolution, georeference status,  topical interest category. These include maps animated to show change over time and drone imagery, as well as satellite imagery.

* **Selection and acquisition of Satellite Imagery**

Selection and acquisition of satellite imagery from a range of providers, both free and purchased. Available satellite paths can be displayed and filtered over any map of interest, so that users can direct their search for relevant satellite imagery to the appropriate satellite service, date and time.

* **Narrative Creation**

Provision of online visualisation features allowing the creation of multi-image narratives.&#x20;

These functions constitute some of the major tasks which Open Source researchers undertake during investigations, making Soar **a multi-purpose platform for OSINV.**

Note that some satellite imagery maps in the Soar database are of very high quality, i.e. 8cm per pixel resolution, making them particularly valuable resources.

[^1]: Soar allows users to view maps in the database, and also make their own annotated copies of those maps. Users can upload their own maps to be added to the database
