Soar's step-by-step guide to creating a Stoary is found [here](https://youtu.be/G97wi-zaTfM?si=5d4vcSnTD4l_RgNj).

To demonstrate narrative creation on Soar's "Stoary", we utilized research conducted by members of the Bellingcat Volunteer Community on Tajikistan.&#x20;

The narrative can be seen [here](https://soaratlas.com/draw/2523) and in the image below.&#x20;
