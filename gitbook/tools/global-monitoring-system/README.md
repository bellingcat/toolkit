## Description

This tool allows us to explore a [growing](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Monitoring-illegal-wildlife-trade-Brazil-and-South-Africa-GI-TOC-October-2024.pdf) phenomenon in the world of wildlife trafficking: the use of social networks and online marketplaces to offer live animals or parts of them. Since 2024, the site has collected more than 700 detections of illegal wildlife trade online.&#x20;

The trade is sometimes <a href="https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Monitoring-illegal-wildlife-trade-Brazil-and-South-Africa-GI-TOC-October-2024.pdf">connected</a> with other illegal markets such as drugs trafficking. The screenshot above is from a video that you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfEKg_pqYvs\">here</a>.</p></figcaption></figure>

You can filter by 24 species, 3 countries (Brazil, South Africa and Thailand) and different online marketplaces such as Facebook, OLX and Mercado Livre (the last two refer to online marketplaces). When you perform a search you will get different visuals showing the number of detections, a market tracker and a trend monitor, all very useful to understand the market prevalence in certain online marketplaces.&#x20;

In addition, you will get a database that lists the website, name, species, type of product (live or parts), where it was sold, among other information. You can also download the whole database.&#x20;

Additionally, there is an [analysis section](https://www.ecosolve.eco/analysis) where you can find different publications and events on online wildlife trade, environmental trade, among other relevant topics from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI TOC).

The ECOSOLVE initiative can be useful for those researching wildlife trade who want to explore online marketplaces and species trade ads. It can be a good place to start looking for patterns and discover the most relevant social networks and online marketplaces to search more thoroughly using other tools.

Information in datasets is not very detailed. There is no information on whether this site is updated manually by a team or whether its updated using keywords appearing in the monitored social media and marketplaces, however, [contributions](https://www.ecosolve.eco/about) can be made to the database, which would indicate that there may be human sources fact checking the information.
