## Description

This tool allows us to explore a [growing](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Monitoring-illegal-wildlife-trade-Brazil-and-South-Africa-GI-TOC-October-2024.pdf) phenomenon in the world of wildlife trafficking: the use of social networks and online marketplaces to offer live animals or parts of them. To date, the tool has [recorded](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/september-2025-the-global-initiative-against-tran-hqs9f/) nearly 13,000 online wildlife trade ads on various platforms, written in 29 different languages, across 10 data hubs.

The trade is sometimes <a href="https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Monitoring-illegal-wildlife-trade-Brazil-and-South-Africa-GI-TOC-October-2024.pdf">connected</a> with other illegal markets such as drugs trafficking. The screenshot above is from a video that you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfEKg_pqYvs\">here</a>.</p></figcaption></figure>

The system allows filtering by 31 species, 16 countries plus unknown location (among the countries you can find Brazil, South Africa, Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Turkey, Thailand) and 40 different online marketplaces such as Instagram, Facebook, OLX and Mercado Livre (the last two refer to online marketplaces). When you perform a search you will get different visuals showing the number of detections, a market tracker and a trend monitor, all very useful to understand the market prevalence in certain online marketplaces.

In addition, you will get a database that lists the website, name, species, type of product (live or parts), where it was sold, among other information. You can also download the whole database.

Additionally, there is an [analysis section](https://www.ecosolve.eco/analysis) where you can find different publications and events on online wildlife trade, environmental trade, among other relevant topics from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI TOC).

The ECOSOLVE initiative can be useful for those researching wildlife trade who want to explore online marketplaces and species trade ads. It can be a good place to start looking for patterns and discover the most relevant social networks and online marketplaces to search more thoroughly using other tools.

ECOSOLVE is not just a tool. Its team also leads various [cooperation initiatives](https://globalinitiative.net/announcements/community-led-responses-to-environmental-crime-in-indonesia/) between local actors and law enforcement agencies to combat environmental crime.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

None.

## Limitations

Not all species are available and the tool only shows results for 16 countries plus unknown location. March 23, 2025 was the last update and information is not updated automatically. Information in datasets is not very detailed. There is no information on whether this site is updated manually by a team or whether its updated using keywords appearing in the monitored social media and marketplaces, however, [contributions](https://www.ecosolve.eco/about) can be made to the database, which would indicate that there may be human sources fact checking the information.

## Ethical Considerations

None so far.
