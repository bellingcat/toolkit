## Description

This tool allows you to explore the trade in wildlife and wildlife-related goods on social media platforms, blogs and online marketplaces since 2024. The site has more than 700 detections of illegal wildlife trade online. You can filter by 24 species, 2 countries (Brazil and South Africa) and different online marketplaces such as Facebook, OLX and Mercado Livre. When you perform a search you will get different visuals showing the number of detections and the most prevalent taxa, a market tracker and a trend monitor, all very useful to understand the market prevalence in certain online marketplaces.&#x20;

In addition, you will get a database that lists the website, name, species, type of product (live or parts), where it was sold, among other information. You can also download the whole database.&#x20;

Additionally, there is an analysis section where you can find different publications and events on online wildlife trade, environmental trade, among other relevant topics from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI TOC).

The ECOSOLVE initiative can be useful for those researching wildlife trade who want to explore online marketplaces and species trade ads. It can be a good place to start looking for patterns and discover the best social networks and online marketplaces to search more thoroughly using other tools.
