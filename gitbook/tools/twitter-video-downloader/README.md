3. Click the **Download** button.
4. Choose the video resolution you prefer (high, medium, or low quality).

6. Right-click (or control-click on Mac) on the video and select **Save Video As**.
7. Rename the file if needed and save it to your desired location.

* **Potential for URL Changes**: If X (Twitter) modifies its media hosting structure, the tool may stop functioning until an update is made.
* **No Audio Extraction**: This tool does not allow users to extract audio from videos.
* **Legal/ToS:** Using third‑party downloaders can conflict with [X’s Terms](https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/legal-twitter/site-assets/terms-of-service-2025-05-08/en/x-terms-of-service-2025-05-08.pdf) (updated **2025‑05‑08**), which restrict scraping/using non‑published interfaces; consider when downloading/redistributing.
