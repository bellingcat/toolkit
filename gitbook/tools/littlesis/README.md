## Description

LittleSis is a database that houses information from a range of online sources on powerful individuals and organisations in the public and private sectors in the Unites States. It seeks to show the relationships between those individuals and organisations, with the aim of helping users to track relationships (e.g. donations to politicians and political action committees, also called PACs, and board memberships). The goal is to help the user to follow the money and discover connections between those that hold public and private sector power.

According to their [website](https://littlesis.org/database), LittleSis includes data from "government filings, news articles, and other reputable sources". It is maintained through automatic updates and manual edits. Links to data sources are provided.

If you search for keywords via the search box (circled in green) at the top of the LittleSis [main website](https://littlesis.org/), you'll get LittleSis news articles:

LittleSis' main offering is their database - to access it, click '[Database](https://littlesis.org/database)' in the top menu. You'll get to the main database page:

When you search the database, you'll get entities that match your search term(s), and network maps that include search term(s):

When you click on an entity name in the search results above, you'll a person's or company/organisation page. Here is a person page:

The person page has links to a wide range of relationships that the person has (for which LittleSis has data). The types of relationships in the example above include business positions, board memberships, positions, federal election campaign contributions, universities attended, holdings (companies in which they have ownership), family, and others.

The 'Interlocks' tab lists people with positions in the same organisations as the person you searched - this can help you see the networks of people with whom they are associated. The 'Giving' tab lists people who also received donations from organisations and people to whom the person donated. The 'Data' tab allows you to filter and search the person's relationships. For instance, here are the lobbying firms in which Hunter Biden holds current or past positions:

Here's an example of an organisation's page:

An organisation page has the same kinds of information as a person's page.

LittleSis includes 'network maps' for all entities (people and organisations):

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 14.59.22.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A network map for Donald Trump</p></figcaption></figure>

Access the network maps from a person's or organisation's search results page. The map will show you relationships that illustrate the topic of the map like donations (e.g. in the map above, Henry R Kravis donated US$1 million to Trump's inauguration). You can create your own maps, but you need to be registered to do that. (To create a map, log in and go to Add>Map.)

LittleSis data is searchable online, can be accessed through an [API](https://littlesis.org/api), and can be [downloaded](https://littlesis.org/database/bulk_data) as JSON files.
