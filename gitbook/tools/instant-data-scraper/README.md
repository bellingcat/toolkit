## Description

Instant Data Scraper is a browser plug-in that works with Microsoft Edge or Chrome based browsers. It allows users to scrape data from a web page, across pages, or with a dynamic crawl for lists that do not load in their entirety, and exports the results as a file into a .csv or .xlsx file to your local storage, without the need to understand how to code. The tool also allows you to choose which table on a page is being scraped.

## Cost

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

Widows Edge or Chrome based browsers (Chrome, Brave).

## Limitations

The tool works on most pages, however it is dependent on the page hosting information in a table based format. The tool is also limited to content that is available via a webpage. Some websites, like social media platforms, may not let you access the table you wish to scrape, or you may have to try different tables than the one immediately suggested.

## Ethical Considerations

Scraping data from a webpage can often include information that is not relevant to an investigation, such as account data for users that are not associated with the target of an investigation. Discretion should be used to protect unrelated entities.

## Guides and articles
